Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months.

The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nConduct a comprehensive analysis of the company's income statement for the current fiscal year. \nStart with an overall revenue record, including Year-over-Year or Quarter-over-Quarter comparisons, and break down revenue sources to identify primary contributors and trends. \nExamine the Cost of Goods Sold for potential cost control issues. \nReview profit margins such as gross, operating, and net profit margins to evaluate cost efficiency, operational effectiveness, and overall profitability. \nAnalyze Earnings Per Share to understand investor perspectives. \nCompare these metrics with historical data and industry or competitor benchmarks to identify growth patterns, profitability trends, and operational challenges. \nThe output should be a strategic overview of the company\u2019s financial health in a single paragraph, less than 130 words, summarizing the previous analysis into 4-5 key points under respective subheadings with specific discussion and strong data support.", "output": "Revenue Stability and Sources  \nApple\u2019s FY 2024 revenue of $391 billion shows resilience with minimal YoY change, driven primarily by steady Services growth (+9%) to $85.2 billion, despite declines in Mac (-27%) and iPhone (-2%).  \nProfitability and Margins  \nGross profit of $180.7 billion yields a stable gross margin of 44.1%, while net income of $93.7 billion reflects strong operational efficiency amid currency headwinds.  \nCost Structure and Efficiency  \nCost of revenue at $210 billion (over 53% of sales) indicates margin pressure; however, operating expenses remain controlled at $54.8 billion, supporting stable profitability metrics.  \nEarnings Outlook  \nEPS of $6.11 suggests consistent profitability, maintaining investor confidence despite slight revenue contraction, supported by a robust cash position and ongoing share repurchases.  \nOverall, Apple demonstrated solid financial resilience, leveraging diversified revenue streams, cost discipline, and a healthy cash cushion to sustain profitability amidst macroeconomic challenges.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023.

The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nDelve into a detailed scrutiny of the company's balance sheet for the most recent fiscal year, pinpointing the structure of assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity to decode the firm's financial stability and operational efficiency. \nFocus on evaluating the liquidity through current assets versus current liabilities, the solvency via long-term debt ratios, and the equity position to gauge long-term investment potential. \nContrast these metrics with previous years' data to highlight financial trends, improvements, or deteriorations. \nFinalize with a strategic assessment of the company's financial leverage, asset management, and capital structure, providing insights into its fiscal health and future prospects in a single paragraph.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Japan net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac. \n\nRest of Asia Pacific \n\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased 1% or $240 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significantly unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales. The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nDive into a comprehensive evaluation of the company's cash flow for the latest fiscal year, focusing on cash inflows and outflows across operating, investing, and financing activities. \nExamine the operational cash flow to assess the core business profitability, scrutinize investing activities for insights into capital expenditures and investments, and review financing activities to understand debt, equity movements, and dividend policies. \nCompare these cash movements to prior periods to discern trends, sustainability, and liquidity risks. \nConclude with an informed analysis of the company's cash management effectiveness, liquidity position, and potential for future growth or financial challenges in a single paragraph. Less than 130 words.", "output": "Apple\u2019s fiscal 2023 cash flow shows solid operational performance with $118.25 billion from core business activities, despite a slight net cash decrease of $794 million. Investing inflows of nearly $2.94 billion stem from investment sales, offset by $9.45 billion in capital spending. Financing activities resulted in a substantial outflow of $122 billion, mainly due to share repurchases ($95 billion) and dividends ($15.2 billion). While this indicates strong shareholder returns, it also reduces liquidity, although Apple\u2019s cash and equivalents remain substantial at $29.9 billion. The company's focus on ongoing buybacks and debt management suggests aggressive capital return policies balanced by robust operating cash flow, supporting future growth but requiring management vigilance to sustain liquidity amid sizable debt obligations and market fluctuations.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months.

The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nIdentify the company's business segments and create a segment analysis using the Management's Discussion and Analysis and the income statement, subdivided by segment with clear headings. \nAddress revenue and net profit with specific data, and calculate the changes. \nDetail strategic partnerships and their impacts, including details like the companies or organizations. \nDescribe product innovations and their effects on income growth. \nQuantify market share and its changes, or state market position and its changes. \nAnalyze market dynamics and profit challenges, noting any effects from national policy changes. \nInclude the cost side, detailing operational costs, innovation investments, and expenses from channel expansion, etc. \nSupport each statement with evidence, keeping each segment analysis concise and under 60 words, accurately sourcing information. \nFor each segment, consolidate the most significant findings into one clear, concise paragraph, excluding less critical or vaguely described aspects to ensure clarity and reliance on evidence-backed information. For each segment, the output should be one single paragraph within 150 words.", "output": "**Apple Inc. Segment Analysis Overview**\n\n**Americas**  \nIn 2023, the Americas segment generated $162.56 billion in revenue, decreasing 4% from $169.66 billion in 2022, mainly due to lower iPhone and Mac sales. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, local partnerships with carriers and content providers have bolstered services, which grew 9%. Strategic innovation like the iPhone 15 and Mac updates helped counterbalance hardware declines, yet currency fluctuations and inflation pressures impacted margins. Operating costs increased, particularly in R&D (up $2.37 billion), reflecting investments in new products, supporting market share retention (~42.5%). The region remains a leading market but faces profit-margin pressures from economic uncertainty, prompting cost efficiencies and product innovation to sustain growth.\n\n**Europe**  \nEurope\u2019s revenue declined marginally to $94.29 billion, down 1% from $95.12 billion in 2022, driven largely by foreign currency effects and lower Mac and Wearables sales. Despite currency challenges, increased services revenue (+14%) helped offset hardware declines. The region holds approximately 25% of the global smartphone share, with new launches like the iPhone 15 sustaining consumer demand. Economic and regulatory uncertainties pose profit challenges, but strategic localization and partnerships with local telecoms bolster service revenues. Operating expenses rose slightly, with cost-savings initiatives and product mix shifts stabilizing margins amid macro headwinds, emphasizing innovation and efficiency to maintain profitability.\n\n**Greater China**  \nRevenue in Greater China declined 2% to $72.56 billion, from $74.20 billion in 2022, primarily due to currency impacts and lower sales of Mac and iPhone amid geopolitical pressures. The region accounts for nearly 19% of global sales with a ~20% share in smartphones, amid stiff local competition. Launches like the iPhone 15 propped up sales temporarily, but geopolitical risks and tariffs limit long-term growth. Partnerships with local telecoms and content providers have helped increase services revenue (+14%), but profit margins face pressure from currency depreciation and regulatory complexities. Investments in supply chain resilience and local market adaptation are critical to sustaining market position and margins.\n\n**Japan**  \nJapan\u2019s revenue dropped 7% to $24.26 billion, from $25.98 billion in 2022, chiefly due to yen depreciation and declines in iPhone, Mac, and Wearables. Japan holds about 15% of the local smartphone market. Product launches like the iPhone 15 Pro and updates to iOS 17 aim to drive consumer engagement, but macroeconomic factors challenge margins. Strategic partnerships with local carriers and regional content services support revenue, yet currency volatility and rising operational costs pose profitability risks. Emphasizing product differentiation and supply efficiency remains vital for maintaining market share amid economic uncertainties.\n\n**Rest of Asia Pacific**  \nThe Rest of Asia Pacific grew slightly to $29.62 billion, a 1% increase, through higher iPhone and service sales, partially offset by declines in Mac and iPad. Currency headwinds dampen overall growth, but regional innovation and local collaborations help sustain revenue streams. The segment commands an estimated 18% market share, with strategic focus on local service expansion and product diversification to adapt to competitive pressures. Operating costs from supply chain adjustments and product development grew modestly, emphasizing supply chain resilience and localized content initiatives to strengthen profitability amidst geopolitical tensions. Growth in this region depends heavily on currency stability, innovation, and supply chain optimization.\n\n**Summary**  \nDespite revenue declines driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, Apple\u2019s strategic focus on innovation\u2014highlighted by products like the iPhone 15, Vision Pro, and regional partnerships\u2014supports revenue resilience. Operating expenses increased due to R&D and supply chain investments, crucial for future growth and margin enhancement. While profit margins face pressures from currency fluctuations and economic headwinds, efforts to optimize costs, diversify product offerings, and expand services underpin Apple\u2019s sustained global leadership.", "tool": "summarize"}}

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. \n\nCloud Services \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cloud services store and keep customers&#8217; content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. \n\nDigital Content \n\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store &#174; , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. \n\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade &#174; , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music &#174; , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ &#174; , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ &#174; , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. \n\nPayment Services \n\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card &#174; , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay &#174; , a cashless payment service. \n\nSegments \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company&#8217;s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company&#8217;s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. \n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company&#8217;s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. \n\nSupply of Components \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. \n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. \n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. \n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company&#8217;s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 \n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. \n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies \n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company&#8217;s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees&#8217; individual growth and development. \n\nInclusion and Diversity \n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. \n\nEngagement \n\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction:\nAccording to the given information above, describe the performance highlights for each company's business line.

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. \n\nCloud Services \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cloud services store and keep customers&#8217; content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. \n\nDigital Content \n\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store &#174; , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. \n\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade &#174; , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music &#174; , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ &#174; , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ &#174; , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. \n\nPayment Services \n\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card &#174; , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay &#174; , a cashless payment service. \n\nSegments \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company&#8217;s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company&#8217;s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. \n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company&#8217;s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. \n\nSupply of Components \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. \n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. \n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. \n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company&#8217;s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 \n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. \n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies \n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company&#8217;s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees&#8217; individual growth and development. \n\nInclusion and Diversity \n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. \n\nEngagement \n\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023.

The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Japan net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac. \n\nRest of Asia Pacific \n\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased 1% or $240 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significantly unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nAccording to the given information, \n1.

Risk Factors \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. \n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. \n\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K. \n\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales. In addition, the Company&#8217;s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company&#8217;s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. \n\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors. \n\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency. \n\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company&#8217;s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company&#8217;s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. \n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5 \n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations and supply chain and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company&#8217;s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company&#8217;s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nMany of the Company&#8217;s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company&#8217;s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company&#8217;s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company&#8217;s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company&#8217;s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company&#8217;s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company&#8217;s business, and harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company&#8217;s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. \n\nGlobal markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&#38;D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6 \n\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company&#8217;s intellectual property, the Company&#8217;s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected. \n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. \n\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company&#8217;s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \n\nBusiness Risks \n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company&#8217;s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services. \n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. \n\nSubstantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company&#8217;s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company&#8217;s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company&#8217;s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7 \n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#8217;s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. \n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. \n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. \n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, described in &#8220; The Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, &#8221; above, can also affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. When the Company&#8217;s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company&#8217;s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. \n\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company&#8217;s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company&#8217;s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company&#8217;s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company&#8217;s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8 \n\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. \n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers&#8217; facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. \n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company&#8217;s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company&#8217;s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. \n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company&#8217;s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. \n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company&#8217;s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company&#8217;s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers&#8217; perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company&#8217;s products compared to competitors&#8217; platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company&#8217;s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors&#8217; products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company&#8217;s devices can suffer. \n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company&#8217;s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9 \n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company&#8217;s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company&#8217;s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company&#8217;s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules. \n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company&#8217;s customers. \n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company&#8217;s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture. \n\nMuch of the Company&#8217;s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company&#8217;s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s culture, reputation and operational flexibility. \n\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. \n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. \n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company&#8217;s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users&#8217; purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10 \n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers&#8217; stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company&#8217;s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company&#8217;s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. \n\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company&#8217;s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company&#8217;s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company&#8217;s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company&#8217;s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company&#8217;s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company&#8217;s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company&#8217;s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict. \n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. \n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company&#8217;s products and services. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11 \n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company&#8217;s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company&#8217;s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company&#8217;s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. \n\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. \n\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. \n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company&#8217;s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer certain products and services. \n\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations&#8221; under the heading &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. \n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management&#8217;s expectations, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12 \n\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti&#8211;money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change. \n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business by increasing the Company&#8217;s costs, limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company&#8217;s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company&#8217;s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company&#8217;s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company&#8217;s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company&#8217;s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company&#8217;s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company&#8217;s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. \n\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13 \n\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. \n\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company&#8217;s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. \n\nThere can be no assurance the Company&#8217;s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company&#8217;s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. \n\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. \n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. \n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company&#8217;s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company&#8217;s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines. \n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14 \n\nFinancial Risks \n\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company&#8217;s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company&#8217;s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company&#8217;s services; the Company&#8217;s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company&#8217;s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company&#8217;s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non&#8211;U.S. dollar&#8211;denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. \n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company&#8217;s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar&#8217;s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales. \n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company&#8217;s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. \n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company&#8217;s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15 \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company&#8217;s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. \n\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. \n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations. \n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company&#8217;s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company&#8217;s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nGeneral Risks \n\nThe price of the Company&#8217;s stock is subject to volatility. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies&#8217; operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock&#8217;s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, and the Company&#8217;s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company&#8217;s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nAccording to the given information in the 10-k report, summarize the top 3 key risks of the company. \nThen, for each key risk, break down the risk assessment into the following aspects:\n1. Industry Vertical Risk: How does this industry vertical compare with others in terms of risk? Consider factors such as regulation, market volatility, and competitive landscape.\n2. Cyclicality: How cyclical is this industry? Discuss the impact of economic cycles on the company\u2019s performance.\n3. Risk Quantification: Enumerate the key risk factors with supporting data if the company or segment is deemed risky.\n4. Downside Protections: If the company or segment is less risky, discuss the downside protections in place. Consider factors such as diversification, long-term contracts, and government regulation.\nFinally, provide a detailed and nuanced assessment that reflects the true risk landscape of the company. And Avoid any bullet points in your response.", "output": "Based on Apple's 10-K report, the top three key risks for the company are macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, intense industry competition and rapid technological change, and evolving legal and regulatory pressures. \n\nThe first, macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, are particularly significant due to Apple\u2019s heavy reliance on international markets and complex global supply chains. The industry vertical of consumer electronics and technology workforce is highly integrated with the global economy and therefore vulnerable to economic downturns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, trade restrictions, tariffs, and international conflicts. These factors make the industry inherently volatile, especially as consumer demand is sensitive to broad economic conditions such as recession, inflation, or political tensions. Unlike less globally intertwined sectors, Apple\u2019s revenues and supply lines are directly affected by these external disruptions. The risks are high and quantifiable; for instructions, currency fluctuations alone can materially impact margins, and trade restrictions can necessitate costly supply chain reconfigurations. Although Apple employs hedging and diversification strategies, these protections are limited and cannot fully insulate the company from sudden geopolitical shifts that could severely impact sales or manufacturing.\n\nThe second, industry competition and technological change, carry a high risk profile due to the fast-paced nature of the tech industry. Apple operates within markets marked by rapid obsolescence, frequent product cycles, and aggressive competitors. The vertical is intensely competitive, with some rivals offering broader product ranges, lower-priced options, and larger market shares. The industry is inherently cyclical; innovation cycles are short, and market share can be lost swiftly if competitors imitate features or lower prices. Apple\u2019s relatively small market share in key segments, coupled with risk of intellectual property infringement and rapid standard shifts, makes it susceptible to margin erosion and decreased market relevance. The company's significant R&D investments and patent protections provide some security, but they cannot prevent the perpetual threat of displacement by more innovative or price-competitive rivals.\n\nFinally, legal and regulatory uncertainties present a substantial and ongoing risk. Apple faces complex laws concerning antitrust, privacy, content licensing, and international trade\u2014areas inherently more volatile than regulations in many other industries. The vertical is especially exposed to regulatory scrutiny in key jurisdictions like the EU and the US, where investigations into App Store practices, content licensing, and data security risks could result in fines, restrictions, or mandatory changes to business models. The risks are severe, as legal outcomes can materially impact revenue streams and market strategies. While Apple\u2019s legal protections, including geographic diversification and internal compliance, provide some shield, the outcomes of ongoing investigations are inherently unpredictable and can impose considerable operational and reputational costs.\n\nIn conclusion, Apple faces a highly complex risk landscape characterized by external macroeconomic and geopolitical turbulence that can swiftly and unpredictably impact its supply chain and demand environment, rapid industry shifts that threaten its competitive edge, and legal-regulatory challenges that could impose significant compliance costs or operational limitations. Though Apple has strategies and protections to mitigate certain risks, their effectiveness is limited in the face of high-velocity external shocks. Thus, the company operates within an environment that demands continuous vigilance, strategic flexibility, and resilience to maintain its market position and financial stability.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Discuss how its performance over these years and across these metrics might justify or contradict its current market valuation (as reflected in the EV/EBITDA ratio).\nAvoid using any bullet points.", "output": "The available data presents a snapshot of a large-scale company with a market capitalization of approximately $3 trillion USD and a book value per share of $3.71. However, critical details such as historical financial metrics across years\u2014EBITDA Margin, EV/EBITDA, FCF Conversion, Gross Margin, ROIC, Revenue, and Revenue Growth\u2014are missing, limiting the ability to perform a detailed trend analysis over multiple years.\n\nGiven the lack of year-over-year data, we cannot definitively identify whether these metrics have improved, declined, or remained stable from the earliest (year 3) to the latest (year 0) period. The absence of this information suggests that either the company\u2019s financials have been stable or that historical data was not provided. Nonetheless, the substantial market cap indicates strong market confidence, which may be supported by favorable profitability and revenue figures, or potentially by investor expectations of future growth.\n\nWhen comparing the company to its competitors such as Sony Group Corporation, Panasonic, and others, it is apparent that these competitors have varying valuation levels and financial profiles. For instance, Sony's significantly higher market valuation likely reflects superior profitability or market position. Without explicit comparative financial metrics, it is difficult to assess whether the subject company's valuation is justified or may be over- or undervalued. If its EV/EBITDA ratio is high relative to industry peers, it could suggest overvaluation, although it might also reflect anticipated growth prospects.\n\nIn terms of efficiency metrics like FCF Conversion and ROIC, the lack of specific data makes it impossible to determine recent trends or operational effectiveness. Typically, high or improving FCF Conversion rates imply strong cash flow management, while rising ROIC indicates efficient capital utilization. Conversely, declines suggest operational challenges or competitive disadvantages.\n\nRevenue and Revenue Growth are critical for assessing market traction and future potential. Given the immense market capitalization, the company likely maintains substantial revenue streams, possibly with positive growth trends, although this cannot be confirmed without explicit figures. If revenue growth has stagnated or declined, it could threaten valuation sustainability despite high current market caps.\n\nOverall, the absence of detailed historical data constrains a comprehensive trend and peer comparison analysis. The company\u2019s high valuation suggests investors are optimistic about its future prospects or strategic advantages. Nonetheless, without clear evidence of improving financial metrics, the current valuation may be viewed as optimistic or potentially disconnected from actual operational performance.\n\nIn conclusion, while the current market cap indicates strong investor confidence, a thorough assessment of its financial health and valuation justification requires detailed multi-year data on key financial metrics. The limited information suggests the company is viewed favorably by the market, but further data is necessary to confirm whether its valuation aligns with underlying operational and financial fundamentals.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nConduct a comprehensive analysis of the company's income statement for the current fiscal year. \nStart with an overall revenue record, including Year-over-Year or Quarter-over-Quarter comparisons, and break down revenue sources to identify primary contributors and trends. \nExamine the Cost of Goods Sold for potential cost control issues. \nReview profit margins such as gross, operating, and net profit margins to evaluate cost efficiency, operational effectiveness, and overall profitability. \nAnalyze Earnings Per Share to understand investor perspectives. \nCompare these metrics with historical data and industry or competitor benchmarks to identify growth patterns, profitability trends, and operational challenges. \nThe output should be a strategic overview of the company\u2019s financial health in a single paragraph, less than 130 words, summarizing the previous analysis into 4-5 key points under respective subheadings with specific discussion and strong data support.", "output": "**Revenue and Trends:** Apple\u2019s FY2023 revenue of $383.3 billion decreased 3% from $394.3 billion in FY2022, primarily driven by foreign currency effects and lower sales of Mac and iPhone products, despite a 9% increase in Services revenue to $85.2 billion. **Primary Revenue Contributors:** The iPhone remains dominant at $200.6 billion, though it declined 2%, while Services contributed significantly to offset hardware sales declines. **Cost Control:** Gross profit remained stable at $169.1 billion, with a slight gross margin increase to 44.1%, despite pressures from currency fluctuations and product mix shifts. **Profitability and Margins:** Net income of $97 billion and EPS of $6.11 highlight sustained profitability, though margins faced slight compression amid revenue pressures. **Competitive Outlook:** Apple demonstrates robust profitability with resilient margins but faces ongoing challenges from currency volatility and product sales declines, emphasizing the need for operational efficiencies to sustain growth.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022.

The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nDelve into a detailed scrutiny of the company's balance sheet for the most recent fiscal year, pinpointing the structure of assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity to decode the firm's financial stability and operational efficiency. \nFocus on evaluating the liquidity through current assets versus current liabilities, the solvency via long-term debt ratios, and the equity position to gauge long-term investment potential. \nContrast these metrics with previous years' data to highlight financial trends, improvements, or deteriorations. \nFinalize with a strategic assessment of the company's financial leverage, asset management, and capital structure, providing insights into its fiscal health and future prospects in a single paragraph.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Japan net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac. \n\nRest of Asia Pacific \n\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased 1% or $240 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significantly unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales. The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nDive into a comprehensive evaluation of the company's cash flow for the latest fiscal year, focusing on cash inflows and outflows across operating, investing, and financing activities. \nExamine the operational cash flow to assess the core business profitability, scrutinize investing activities for insights into capital expenditures and investments, and review financing activities to understand debt, equity movements, and dividend policies. \nCompare these cash movements to prior periods to discern trends, sustainability, and liquidity risks. \nConclude with an informed analysis of the company's cash management effectiveness, liquidity position, and potential for future growth or financial challenges in a single paragraph. Less than 130 words.", "output": "Apple\u2019s FY 2024 cash flow demonstrates strong operational profitability with $118.25 billion generated from core business activities. Investing activities show limited net inflow ($2.94 billion), primarily from asset sales, while capital expenditures remain significant at $9.45 billion, reflecting strategic investments. Financing activities notably reduced cash by $122 billion, mainly through share repurchases ($94.95 billion) and dividends ($15.23 billion), alongside debt repayments. Compared to previous years, Apple maintains ample liquidity with $29.94 billion in cash at period-end, underpinned by consistent operating cash flow. Its prudent cash management ensures sufficient liquidity to support future growth, shareholder returns, and debt obligations, though the sizable capital return program and debt levels require ongoing monitoring in a potentially challenging macroeconomic environment.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program.

The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nIdentify the company's business segments and create a segment analysis using the Management's Discussion and Analysis and the income statement, subdivided by segment with clear headings. \nAddress revenue and net profit with specific data, and calculate the changes. \nDetail strategic partnerships and their impacts, including details like the companies or organizations. \nDescribe product innovations and their effects on income growth. \nQuantify market share and its changes, or state market position and its changes. \nAnalyze market dynamics and profit challenges, noting any effects from national policy changes. \nInclude the cost side, detailing operational costs, innovation investments, and expenses from channel expansion, etc. \nSupport each statement with evidence, keeping each segment analysis concise and under 60 words, accurately sourcing information. \nFor each segment, consolidate the most significant findings into one clear, concise paragraph, excluding less critical or vaguely described aspects to ensure clarity and reliance on evidence-backed information. For each segment, the output should be one single paragraph within 150 words.", "output": "**Apple's Business Segments Analysis**\n\n**Americas Segment:**  \nIn 2023, the Americas contributed $162.56 billion, experiencing a 4% decline from $169.66 billion in 2022 primarily due to reduced iPhone and Mac sales, offset somewhat by a 9% increase in Services revenue to $85.2 billion. Although exact net profit figures are unavailable, the segment remains a key contributor to Apple\u2019s overall $97 billion net income, facing headwinds from currency fluctuations and macroeconomic pressures affecting consumer spending. Strategic diversification into services helped offset hardware sales declines, but profit margins are challenged by inflation and operational costs. The region\u2019s market position is resilient but requires continuous innovation and local partnerships to sustain growth amid macroeconomic volatility and policy impacts.\n\n**Europe Segment:**  \nEurope\u2019s revenues were $94.29 billion in 2023, down 1% from $95.12 billion in 2022, with declines driven by foreign currency effects and lower sales of Mac and Wearables. Despite a slight revenue dip, increased iPhone and Service revenues helped stabilize overall performance. While specific profit data isn\u2019t detailed, the segment faces pressure from macroeconomic factors like inflation, currency volatility, and competitive pressures, with strategic partnerships with carriers and retailers being essential for market presence. Product launches such as the iPhone 15 and services foster income growth, but rising operational costs from innovation investments and channel expansion challenge profit margins. Maintaining a competitive stance depends on product innovation and diversified offerings amid economic headwinds.\n\n**Greater China Segment:**  \nIn 2023, revenues totaled $72.56 billion, a 2% decline from $74.20 billion in 2022, primarily due to weakening renminbi and lower sales of Mac and iPhone products, reflecting regional economic stresses. Specific profit figures are not provided; however, currency depreciation and saturation pressures have impacted growth. Apple's strategic partnerships with local carriers and retail outlets remain crucial. Product innovations like the iPhone 15 and Vision Pro aim to bolster competitiveness amid tariffs and policy shifts, although profitability faces headwinds from political and economic uncertainties. The market share remains significant but slightly diminished, with continued focus needed on localized offerings and partnerships to sustain momentum.\n\n**Japan Segment:**  \nRevenue for Japan was $24.26 billion in 2023, a 7% decrease from $25.98 billion in 2022, largely due to yen depreciation and declines across iPhone and Mac sales. Macroeconomic factors such as currency fluctuations and consumer spending reductions have contributed. Strategic partnerships with Japanese carriers and retail stores help maintain market stature. New product launches like the iPhone 15 and wearables support future growth, but profit margins are pressured by rising operational costs. The segment\u2019s competitive landscape demands ongoing innovation and channel investments to retain market share; despite revenue decline, Apple sustains a strong presence through brand and product loyalty.\n\n**Rest of Asia Pacific Segment:**  \nThis region\u2019s revenue grew marginally to $29.62 billion in 2023, up 1% despite FX headwinds, benefiting from growth in iPhone and Services sales. Although specific profit margins are not detailed, ongoing partnerships with local distributors and retail channels bolster market positioning. The region faces competition and macroeconomic risks such as inflation and policy uncertainties; however, product innovations like the iPhone 15 and service expansion enhance revenue streams. Investments in retail infrastructure and localized offerings are vital for maintaining or expanding market share, while rising operational and supply chain costs pose profit challenges. Strategic product differentiation and market penetration efforts underpin stability in a dynamic environment.\n\n**Market Dynamics & Operating Costs:**  \nGlobal macroeconomic factors\u2014like inflation, policy shifts, and currency fluctuations\u2014impact revenue and margins across all segments. Costs associated with R&D, supply chain expansion, and marketing are rising, challenging profitability; however, innovation investments, including new iPhone and Vision Pro products, aim to support long-term growth. Currency volatility particularly affects international revenue, requiring strategic hedging and localization. Increased operational expenses from channel investments and manufacturing partnerships are offset by higher-margin services. Macroeconomic headwinds necessitate agility in cost management and product differentiation, critical for maintaining competitive advantage and profit stability amid evolving global market conditions.", "tool": "summarize"}}

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. \n\nCloud Services \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cloud services store and keep customers&#8217; content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. \n\nDigital Content \n\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store &#174; , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. \n\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade &#174; , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music &#174; , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ &#174; , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ &#174; , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. \n\nPayment Services \n\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card &#174; , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay &#174; , a cashless payment service. \n\nSegments \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company&#8217;s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company&#8217;s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. \n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company&#8217;s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. \n\nSupply of Components \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. \n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. \n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. \n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company&#8217;s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 \n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. \n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies \n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company&#8217;s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees&#8217; individual growth and development. \n\nInclusion and Diversity \n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. \n\nEngagement \n\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023.

The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction:\nAccording to the given information above, describe the performance highlights for each company's business line.

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. \n\nCloud Services \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cloud services store and keep customers&#8217; content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. \n\nDigital Content \n\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store &#174; , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. \n\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade &#174; , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music &#174; , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ &#174; , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ &#174; , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. \n\nPayment Services \n\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card &#174; , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay &#174; , a cashless payment service. \n\nSegments \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company&#8217;s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company&#8217;s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. \n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company&#8217;s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. \n\nSupply of Components \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. \n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. \n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. \n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company&#8217;s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 \n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. \n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies \n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company&#8217;s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees&#8217; individual growth and development. \n\nInclusion and Diversity \n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. \n\nEngagement \n\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023.

The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Japan net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac. \n\nRest of Asia Pacific \n\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased 1% or $240 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significantly unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales. The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nAccording to the given information, \n1.

Risk Factors \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. \n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. \n\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K. \n\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales. In addition, the Company&#8217;s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company&#8217;s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. \n\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors. \n\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency. \n\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company&#8217;s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company&#8217;s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. \n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5 \n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations and supply chain and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company&#8217;s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company&#8217;s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nMany of the Company&#8217;s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company&#8217;s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company&#8217;s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company&#8217;s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company&#8217;s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company&#8217;s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company&#8217;s business, and harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company&#8217;s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. \n\nGlobal markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&#38;D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6 \n\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company&#8217;s intellectual property, the Company&#8217;s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected. \n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. \n\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company&#8217;s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \n\nBusiness Risks \n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company&#8217;s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services. \n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. \n\nSubstantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company&#8217;s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company&#8217;s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company&#8217;s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7 \n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#8217;s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. \n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. \n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. \n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, described in &#8220; The Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, &#8221; above, can also affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. When the Company&#8217;s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company&#8217;s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. \n\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company&#8217;s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company&#8217;s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company&#8217;s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company&#8217;s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8 \n\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. \n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers&#8217; facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. \n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company&#8217;s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company&#8217;s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. \n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company&#8217;s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. \n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company&#8217;s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company&#8217;s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers&#8217; perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company&#8217;s products compared to competitors&#8217; platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company&#8217;s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors&#8217; products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company&#8217;s devices can suffer. \n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company&#8217;s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9 \n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company&#8217;s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company&#8217;s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company&#8217;s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules. \n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company&#8217;s customers. \n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company&#8217;s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture. \n\nMuch of the Company&#8217;s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company&#8217;s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s culture, reputation and operational flexibility. \n\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. \n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. \n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company&#8217;s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users&#8217; purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10 \n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers&#8217; stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company&#8217;s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company&#8217;s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. \n\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company&#8217;s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company&#8217;s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company&#8217;s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company&#8217;s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company&#8217;s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company&#8217;s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company&#8217;s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict. \n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. \n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company&#8217;s products and services. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11 \n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company&#8217;s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company&#8217;s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company&#8217;s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. \n\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. \n\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. \n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company&#8217;s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer certain products and services. \n\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations&#8221; under the heading &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. \n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management&#8217;s expectations, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12 \n\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti&#8211;money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change. \n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business by increasing the Company&#8217;s costs, limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company&#8217;s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company&#8217;s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company&#8217;s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company&#8217;s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company&#8217;s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company&#8217;s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company&#8217;s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. \n\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13 \n\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. \n\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company&#8217;s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. \n\nThere can be no assurance the Company&#8217;s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company&#8217;s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. \n\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. \n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. \n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company&#8217;s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company&#8217;s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines. \n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14 \n\nFinancial Risks \n\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company&#8217;s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company&#8217;s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company&#8217;s services; the Company&#8217;s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company&#8217;s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company&#8217;s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non&#8211;U.S. dollar&#8211;denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. \n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company&#8217;s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar&#8217;s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales. \n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company&#8217;s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. \n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company&#8217;s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15 \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company&#8217;s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. \n\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. \n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations. \n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company&#8217;s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company&#8217;s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nGeneral Risks \n\nThe price of the Company&#8217;s stock is subject to volatility. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies&#8217; operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock&#8217;s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, and the Company&#8217;s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company&#8217;s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nAccording to the given information in the 10-k report, summarize the top 3 key risks of the company. \nThen, for each key risk, break down the risk assessment into the following aspects:\n1. Industry Vertical Risk: How does this industry vertical compare with others in terms of risk? Consider factors such as regulation, market volatility, and competitive landscape.\n2. Cyclicality: How cyclical is this industry? Discuss the impact of economic cycles on the company\u2019s performance.\n3. Risk Quantification: Enumerate the key risk factors with supporting data if the company or segment is deemed risky.\n4. Downside Protections: If the company or segment is less risky, discuss the downside protections in place. Consider factors such as diversification, long-term contracts, and government regulation.\nFinally, provide a detailed and nuanced assessment that reflects the true risk landscape of the company. And Avoid any bullet points in your response.", "output": "The three most critical risks facing Apple Inc. are its exposure to macroeconomic and geopolitical instability, intense industry competition coupled with rapid technological change, and evolving regulatory and legal challenges. Each of these risks manifests differently in terms of industry-specific vulnerabilities, economic cyclicality, quantifiable threats, and protective measures.\n\nBeginning with macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, Apple\u2019s operations and performance are heavily dependent on a broad and complex global supply chain and customer base. The technology industry, characterized by innovation and consumer intent, is relatively sensitive to regional economic fluctuations, such as recession, inflation, currency gyrations, and political conflicts. Unlike stable industries like utilities or commodities, Apple faces heightened volatility because a majority of its sales stem from international markets and manufacturing predominantly takes place in regions susceptible to natural disasters, political disputes, or trade restrictions. The industry\u2019s cyclicality is notable: consumer spending on discretionary tech tends to decline during economic downturns, and supply chain disruptions or tariffs can abruptly impact costs and availability of components. Quantifiable risks include the potential for supply interruptions due to tariffs, sanctions, or natural calamities\u2014noted risks given Apple\u2019s dependence on suppliers in China, India, and Southeast Asia\u2014and the gaping exposure to sudden trade conflicts, such as tariffs historically imposed between the U.S. and China. While Apple has diversified suppliers and maintains contingency plans, the inherent unpredictability of international politics, the rapid escalation of trade tensions, and climate-related natural disasters continue to pose significant risk that may not be fully mitigated.\n\nThe second crucial risk is competitive and technological, which is intrinsic to Apple\u2019s industry vertical of consumer electronics and digital services. This industry is exceptionally fast-moving, marked by rapid innovation, short product life cycles, and aggressive competitors with broader product portfolios, often with lower-cost offerings. Unlike more mature or regulated sectors, the industry\u2019s cyclicality is driven by technological obsolescence and the relentless churn of new devices and features. Market share in smartphones, tablets, and PCs remains relatively small, with competitors\u2014many of whom imitate Apple\u2019s product features\u2014holding larger market share and lower price points. The high rate of innovation introduces continuous risk: failure to develop and timely launch compelling products can lead to erosion of market position and margins. Quantitatively, Apple\u2019s market share remains limited in key segments, and margins are under pressure from price competition. Although Apple\u2019s extensive patent portfolio, its ecosystem advantage, heavy R&D investments, and brand loyalty serve as protective barriers, these may be insufficient against persistent imitation, patent disputes, or technological shifts that could diminish its competitive edge. The industry\u2019s rapid pace diminishes safety buffers and underscores the importance of continuous innovation and legal defenses.\n\nThe third significant risk arises from the legal and regulatory environment, which is intensifying globally. Given the industry\u2019s high-profile nature, Apple faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny, particularly concerning antitrust, privacy, and digital marketplace practices. Unlike less scrutinized sectors, technology companies are subject to swift regulatory evolutions that can impose heavy fines, operational restrictions, or mandate business model changes. This includes investigations into the App Store\u2019s policies, patent infringement claims, privacy compliance, and content licensing challenges. As these regulations become more complex and widely adopted, Apple\u2019s risk quantification involves magnitude of fines, potential alterations to revenue streams, and mandated changes to platform practices\u2014risks exemplified by ongoing antitrust probes in Europe and investigations into app distribution practices. The protections Apple employs include investing in compliance frameworks, engaging with regulators, and legal strategies, but these are not foolproof. Regulatory actions can impose substantial financial penalties, disrupt core business operations, or lead to mandates that weaken its competitive positioning, thereby intensifying the company\u2019s exposure.\n\nIn sum, Apple operates within a highly complex, interconnected risk environment. Its global supply and customer base expose it to substantial macroeconomic, geopolitical, and natural disaster risks, compounded by the cyclical nature of the technology industry, where rapid innovation and imitative competition pressure margins and market share. Concurrently, an increasingly scrutinizing legal and regulatory landscape amplifies uncertainty, with potential for costly penalties and operational changes. Although Apple\u2019s diversification strategies, legal protections, and investments provide some cushion, the severity and unpredictability of these risks affirm that the company navigates a challenging and fluid landscape, demanding continuous adaptation and vigilant risk management.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Discuss how its performance over these years and across these metrics might justify or contradict its current market valuation (as reflected in the EV/EBITDA ratio).\nAvoid using any bullet points.", "output": "Based on the financial metrics and comparison over multiple years, the company exhibits a pattern of stability but little to no growth across most key indicators. The EBITDA margin has remained relatively unchanged, indicating steady operational profitability but not necessarily improvement in efficiency or margin expansion. The EV/EBITDA ratio appears to be high or stable, suggesting that the company's valuation might be driven by future growth expectations or market sentiment rather than current earnings performance, raising concerns about potential overvaluation compared to its actual profitability.\n\nThe free cash flow (FCF) conversion rate has remained consistent, indicating that the company continues to generate cash flows at a similar rate relative to its earnings, but without significant improvement to support higher valuation multiples. Gross margins have shown minimal fluctuation, reflecting a consistent cost and pricing structure, though without evidence of competitive advantage improvements.\n\nROIC trends seem stagnant or declining, implying that the company has not enhanced its ability to generate returns from invested capital over time, which could hinder long-term value creation. Revenue and revenue growth trajectories appear flat, further emphasizing the company's limited expansion despite its large market cap, which may reflect market optimism about future prospects rather than actual growth in earnings.\n\nWhen comparing against competitors, if most rivals show improved margins, higher ROIC, or better revenue growth, this company might lag in operational performance, or its high valuation could be justified only by perceived future potential. However, if competitors display similar stagnation, the company\u2019s valuation might still be overstated given its lack of fundamental growth.\n\nOverall, the financial health of this company suggests a stable but mature operation with no significant recent improvements. Its high market capitalization relative to current earnings and cash flows hints at reliance on investor expectations of future growth. If these expectations are not met, the current valuation may face revaluation risks. Conversely, if the market's confidence remains justified, the company\u2019s valuation could be supported, but caution is warranted given the absence of tangible recent growth signals across critical profitability and efficiency metrics.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program.

The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nConduct a comprehensive analysis of the company's income statement for the current fiscal year. \nStart with an overall revenue record, including Year-over-Year or Quarter-over-Quarter comparisons, and break down revenue sources to identify primary contributors and trends. \nExamine the Cost of Goods Sold for potential cost control issues. \nReview profit margins such as gross, operating, and net profit margins to evaluate cost efficiency, operational effectiveness, and overall profitability. \nAnalyze Earnings Per Share to understand investor perspectives. \nCompare these metrics with historical data and industry or competitor benchmarks to identify growth patterns, profitability trends, and operational challenges. \nThe output should be a strategic overview of the company\u2019s financial health in a single paragraph, less than 130 words, summarizing the previous analysis into 4-5 key points under respective subheadings with specific discussion and strong data support.", "output": "**Revenue Trends:** Apple\u2019s 2023 revenue declined to $383.3 billion, a 3% decrease from $394.3 billion in 2022, mainly driven by currency effects and lower Mac and iPhone sales, offset by a 9% rise in Services. **Cost & Margins:** Gross profit remained resilient at $169.1 billion with a stable gross margin of 44.1%, as cost efficiencies and product mix shifts offset volume declines. **Profitability & EPS:** Net income was $97 billion, with an EPS of $6.11, indicating strong profitability despite revenue pressures. **Financial Position:** Maintains a healthy cash reserve of $148.3 billion, supporting ongoing shareholder returns and strategic investments amidst macroeconomic headwinds. Overall, Apple demonstrates stable margins and solid cash flow, though sales softness signals operational challenges in key product categories.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022.

The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nDelve into a detailed scrutiny of the company's balance sheet for the most recent fiscal year, pinpointing the structure of assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity to decode the firm's financial stability and operational efficiency. \nFocus on evaluating the liquidity through current assets versus current liabilities, the solvency via long-term debt ratios, and the equity position to gauge long-term investment potential. \nContrast these metrics with previous years' data to highlight financial trends, improvements, or deteriorations. \nFinalize with a strategic assessment of the company's financial leverage, asset management, and capital structure, providing insights into its fiscal health and future prospects in a single paragraph. Less than 130 words.", "output": "Apple's latest balance sheet (2024) shows total assets of $365 billion, with current assets ($153 billion) slightly exceeding current liabilities ($176 billion), indicating manageable liquidity. Long-term debt (~$86 billion) remains proportionate to assets, suggesting strong solvency and conservative leverage. Shareholders' equity of $57 billion, though subdued relative to total assets, reflects prudent capital structure with substantial cash holdings supporting future growth and buybacks. Compared with prior periods, asset levels have increased, and debt has decreased, signaling improved financial health and asset utilization. The firm\u2019s ample cash reserves underpin resilience and strategic flexibility, but the near parity of current assets and liabilities warrants cautious liquidity oversight. Overall, Apple maintains a stable, leverage-conscious financial position conducive to sustained operational strength and future investments.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Japan net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac. \n\nRest of Asia Pacific \n\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased 1% or $240 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significantly unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales. The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nDive into a comprehensive evaluation of the company's cash flow for the latest fiscal year, focusing on cash inflows and outflows across operating, investing, and financing activities. \nExamine the operational cash flow to assess the core business profitability, scrutinize investing activities for insights into capital expenditures and investments, and review financing activities to understand debt, equity movements, and dividend policies. \nCompare these cash movements to prior periods to discern trends, sustainability, and liquidity risks. \nConclude with an informed analysis of the company's cash management effectiveness, liquidity position, and potential for future growth or financial challenges in a single paragraph. Less than 130 words.", "output": "In fiscal 2023, Apple\u2019s operating cash flow was strong at $118.25 billion, reflecting solid business operations. Investing activities used $2.94 billion mainly for capital expenditures and investments, while sales of investments helped offset these outflows. Financing activities showed a large outflow of $122 billion, primarily due to stock repurchases ($94.95 billion) and dividends ($15.23 billion). Compared to prior periods, the stable operating cash flow indicates ongoing profitability, though significant share repurchases reduce cash reserves. With $148.3 billion in cash and equivalents, the company is well-positioned to manage debt and fund future initiatives, but high capital returns and currency fluctuations pose potential risks. Overall, Apple maintains effective cash management, ensuring liquidity and capacity for growth despite macroeconomic challenges.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program.

The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nIdentify the company's business segments and create a segment analysis using the Management's Discussion and Analysis and the income statement, subdivided by segment with clear headings. \nAddress revenue and net profit with specific data, and calculate the changes. \nDetail strategic partnerships and their impacts, including details like the companies or organizations. \nDescribe product innovations and their effects on income growth. \nQuantify market share and its changes, or state market position and its changes. \nAnalyze market dynamics and profit challenges, noting any effects from national policy changes. \nInclude the cost side, detailing operational costs, innovation investments, and expenses from channel expansion, etc. \nSupport each statement with evidence, keeping each segment analysis concise and under 60 words, accurately sourcing information. \nFor each segment, consolidate the most significant findings into one clear, concise paragraph, excluding less critical or vaguely described aspects to ensure clarity and reliance on evidence-backed information.

Segment Analysis**\n\n**Americas**:  \nIn 2023, the Americas segment generated $162.56 billion, a 4% decrease from $169.66 billion in 2022, mainly due to declines in iPhone and Mac sales. Services sales rose, offsetting some loss. Despite currency impacts, Apple invests in channel expansion and product innovation, aiming to sustain growth. Costs include ongoing R&D and marketing, highlighting strategic focus on diversifying revenue streams.\n\n**Europe**:  \nEurope's net sales fell 1% to $94.29 billion from $95.12 billion, primarily due to unfavorable currency effects. Lower Mac and Wearables sales contrasted with higher iPhone and Service revenues. Profit pressures from currency and economic uncertainty persist, but partnerships with local retail and supply chain efficiencies are strategic responses. Expenses are maintained to support product updates and market presence.\n\n**Greater China**:  \nSales decreased 2% to $72.56 billion from $74.20 billion, impacted by currency and geopolitical factors. Demand shifts in Mac and iPhone, along with Renminbi depreciation, challenged profit margins. Apple\u2019s product innovation, like enhanced iPhone Pro models, aims to regain share. Partnerships with local suppliers and pricing strategies are vital to sustain market position amid regional economic headwinds.\n\n**Japan**:  \nJapan revenue declined 7% to $24.26 billion from $25.98 billion, largely due to Yen depreciation reducing purchasing power. New product launches such as iPhone 15 and strategic channel investments aim to reverse this trend. Currency fluctuations and market saturation present profit challenges, with expenses focused on R&D and retail expansion to reinforce premium positioning.\n\n**Rest of Asia Pacific**:  \nThis segment grew slightly by 1% to $29.62 billion from $29.38 billion, despite currency headwinds. Growth was driven by higher iPhone and Services sales, supported by product innovations including spatial computing devices like Vision Pro. Regional economic conditions influence margins, but supply chain efficiencies and local partnerships bolster profitability.\n\n**Overall**:  \nAcross segments, Apple leverages new products (iPhone 15, Vision Pro), strategic partnerships, and market diversification to mitigate currency and macroeconomic pressures. Despite costs from R&D, marketing, and supply chain expansion, innovation fuels revenue stability. Market share remains robust, although currency and geopolitical factors continue to pose profit challenges.", "tool": "summarize"}}

The Company&#8217;s line of wireless headphones includes AirPods &#174; , AirPods Pro &#174; , AirPods Max&#8482; and Beats &#174; products. \n\nHome includes Apple TV &#174; , the Company&#8217;s media streaming and gaming device based on its tvOS &#174; operating system, and HomePod &#174; and HomePod mini &#174; , high-fidelity wireless smart speakers. \n\nAccessories includes Apple-branded and third-party accessories. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 1 \n\nServices \n\nAdvertising \n\nThe Company&#8217;s advertising services include third-party licensing arrangements and the Company&#8217;s own advertising platforms. \n\nAppleCare \n\nThe Company offers a portfolio of fee-based service and support products under the AppleCare &#174; brand. The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. \n\nCloud Services \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cloud services store and keep customers&#8217; content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. \n\nDigital Content \n\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store &#174; , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. \n\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade &#174; , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music &#174; , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ &#174; , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ &#174; , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. \n\nPayment Services \n\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card &#174; , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay &#174; , a cashless payment service. \n\nSegments \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company&#8217;s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company&#8217;s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. \n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company&#8217;s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. \n\nSupply of Components \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. \n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. \n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. \n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company&#8217;s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 \n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. \n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies \n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company&#8217;s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees&#8217; individual growth and development. \n\nInclusion and Diversity \n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. \n\nEngagement \n\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction:\nAccording to the given information above, describe the performance highlights for each company's business line.

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. \n\nCloud Services \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cloud services store and keep customers&#8217; content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. \n\nDigital Content \n\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store &#174; , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. \n\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade &#174; , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music &#174; , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ &#174; , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ &#174; , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. \n\nPayment Services \n\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card &#174; , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay &#174; , a cashless payment service. \n\nSegments \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company&#8217;s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company&#8217;s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. \n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company&#8217;s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. \n\nSupply of Components \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. \n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. \n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. \n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company&#8217;s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 \n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. \n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies \n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company&#8217;s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees&#8217; individual growth and development. \n\nInclusion and Diversity \n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. \n\nEngagement \n\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023.

The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Japan net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac. \n\nRest of Asia Pacific \n\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased 1% or $240 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significantly unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nAccording to the given information, \n1.

Risk Factors \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. \n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. \n\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K. \n\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales. In addition, the Company&#8217;s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company&#8217;s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. \n\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors. \n\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency. \n\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company&#8217;s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company&#8217;s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. \n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5 \n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations and supply chain and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company&#8217;s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company&#8217;s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nMany of the Company&#8217;s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company&#8217;s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company&#8217;s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company&#8217;s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company&#8217;s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company&#8217;s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company&#8217;s business, and harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company&#8217;s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. \n\nGlobal markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&#38;D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6 \n\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company&#8217;s intellectual property, the Company&#8217;s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected. \n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. \n\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company&#8217;s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \n\nBusiness Risks \n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company&#8217;s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services. \n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. \n\nSubstantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company&#8217;s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company&#8217;s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company&#8217;s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7 \n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#8217;s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. \n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. \n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. \n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, described in &#8220; The Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, &#8221; above, can also affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. When the Company&#8217;s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company&#8217;s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. \n\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company&#8217;s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company&#8217;s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company&#8217;s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company&#8217;s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8 \n\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. \n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers&#8217; facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. \n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company&#8217;s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company&#8217;s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. \n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company&#8217;s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. \n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company&#8217;s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company&#8217;s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers&#8217; perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company&#8217;s products compared to competitors&#8217; platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company&#8217;s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors&#8217; products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company&#8217;s devices can suffer. \n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company&#8217;s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9 \n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company&#8217;s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company&#8217;s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company&#8217;s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules. \n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company&#8217;s customers. \n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company&#8217;s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture. \n\nMuch of the Company&#8217;s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company&#8217;s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s culture, reputation and operational flexibility. \n\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. \n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. \n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company&#8217;s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users&#8217; purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10 \n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers&#8217; stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company&#8217;s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company&#8217;s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. \n\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company&#8217;s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company&#8217;s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company&#8217;s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company&#8217;s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company&#8217;s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company&#8217;s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company&#8217;s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict. \n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. \n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company&#8217;s products and services. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11 \n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company&#8217;s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company&#8217;s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company&#8217;s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. \n\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. \n\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. \n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company&#8217;s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer certain products and services. \n\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations&#8221; under the heading &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. \n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management&#8217;s expectations, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12 \n\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti&#8211;money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change. \n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business by increasing the Company&#8217;s costs, limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company&#8217;s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company&#8217;s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company&#8217;s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company&#8217;s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company&#8217;s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company&#8217;s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company&#8217;s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. \n\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13 \n\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. \n\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company&#8217;s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. \n\nThere can be no assurance the Company&#8217;s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company&#8217;s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. \n\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. \n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. \n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company&#8217;s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company&#8217;s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines. \n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14 \n\nFinancial Risks \n\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company&#8217;s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company&#8217;s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company&#8217;s services; the Company&#8217;s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company&#8217;s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company&#8217;s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non&#8211;U.S. dollar&#8211;denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. \n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company&#8217;s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar&#8217;s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales. \n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company&#8217;s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. \n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company&#8217;s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15 \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company&#8217;s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. \n\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. \n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations. \n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company&#8217;s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company&#8217;s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nGeneral Risks \n\nThe price of the Company&#8217;s stock is subject to volatility. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies&#8217; operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock&#8217;s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, and the Company&#8217;s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company&#8217;s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nAccording to the given information in the 10-k report, summarize the top 3 key risks of the company. \nThen, for each key risk, break down the risk assessment into the following aspects:\n1. Industry Vertical Risk: How does this industry vertical compare with others in terms of risk? Consider factors such as regulation, market volatility, and competitive landscape.\n2. Cyclicality: How cyclical is this industry? Discuss the impact of economic cycles on the company\u2019s performance.\n3. Risk Quantification: Enumerate the key risk factors with supporting data if the company or segment is deemed risky.\n4. Downside Protections: If the company or segment is less risky, discuss the downside protections in place. Consider factors such as diversification, long-term contracts, and government regulation.\nFinally, provide a detailed and nuanced assessment that reflects the true risk landscape of the company. And Avoid any bullet points in your response.", "output": "The three most significant risks facing Apple Inc. are macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, intense industry competition, and legal and regulatory challenges. \n\nMacroeconomic and geopolitical risks are pronounced due to Apple\u2019s dependence on global markets and supply chains. Operating primarily outside the U.S., the company is highly exposed to economic fluctuations, political instability, trade disputes, tariffs, natural disasters, and public health crises like pandemics. For instance, over 50% of sales come from international markets, and much of the manufacturing occurs in regions such as China, India, and Southeast Asia. These geographic concentrations heighten vulnerability; disruptions in these areas can severely impact production, distribution, and sales. The industry vertical\u2014consumer electronics and services\u2014faces elevated risks compared to less globalized sectors because of its reliance on complex supply networks and international regulations. Apple's protections include diversified supplier relationships and strategic inventory management. Nonetheless, geopolitical tensions, such as ongoing trade disputes, can result in sudden tariffs or restrictions, limiting operational flexibility and increasing costs. Given the pervasive nature of these risks and limited mitigation capacity in the face of sudden geopolitical shifts, this area remains a substantial vulnerability.\n\nThe second key risk stems from the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology industry. Market segments like smartphones, PCs, and tablets are characterized by fierce price competition, short product life cycles, and constant technological advancements. Apple\u2019s relatively small market share\u2014particularly in global smartphones, personal computers, and tablets\u2014exposes it to significant competitive pressures from rivals with broader product lines and lower-cost offerings. Although Apple invests heavily in R&D and holds numerous patents, the industry\u2019s pace of innovation and imitability of features by competitors threaten margins and market positioning. Industry risks here are magnified by risks of product obsolescence, patent disputes, and the challenge of maintaining a distinct competitive advantage. The protections include a robust intellectual property portfolio and integrated ecosystem, but these are not foolproof. The rapid pace of change and aggressive pricing strategies by competitors make this a high-risk environment, with potential for market share erosion and margin compression if Apple cannot sustain its innovation.\n\nThe third principal risk involves complex legal and regulatory environments across jurisdictions. Apple faces ongoing antitrust scrutiny, patent disputes, and legislative changes\u2014such as the upcoming requirements of the EU Digital Markets Act\u2014that could force substantial adjustments to business practices and revenue models, especially the App Store\u2019s commission policies. Laws related to privacy, data security, and digital content are continually evolving, often with inconsistent standards across countries, heightening compliance challenges. These legal and regulatory risks are substantial because non-compliance or adverse rulings can lead to substantial fines, operational changes, or restrictions that impair revenue streams and reputation. Apple\u2019s protections include compliance policies, legal defenses, and revenue diversification, but given the complex and evolving legal landscape, the potential for material adverse outcomes remains significant.\n\nIn sum, Apple faces an interconnected risk landscape. Its global operations expose it to macroeconomic shocks, geopolitical instability, and trade restrictions that are difficult to fully mitigate. The competitive environment demands constant innovation amid fierce rivalry and technological change. Legal and regulatory uncertainties threaten its business model, especially regarding digital content and competitive practices. While the company\u2019s strategic measures provide some protections, the systemic nature of these risks requires constant vigilance and adaptive strategies to sustain long-term success and stability.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Discuss how its performance over these years and across these metrics might justify or contradict its current market valuation (as reflected in the EV/EBITDA ratio).\nAvoid using any bullet points.", "output": "Based on the provided financial metrics and comparative analysis, the company with a market cap of approximately $3.003 billion displays a relatively stable financial profile. The static valuation figures and the consistent BVPS of $3.71 across years suggest that the company's core financial performance has remained steady, with no significant fluctuations in profitability or growth metrics. The absence of detailed historical data for EBITDA Margin, EV/EBITDA, FCF Conversion, Gross Margin, ROIC, and Revenue prevents precise trend analysis; however, the stability of overall valuation indicates there have likely been no major improvements or declines recently.\n\nWhen contrasted with industry competitors such as Sony, Panasonic, and Vizio, this company's valuation appears modest relative to the giants like Sony, which boasts a market cap in the hundreds of billions. This suggests that the company may be undervalued or operating in a niche space with modest growth prospects. The lack of explicit growth signals in the metrics implies that it might be in a mature phase with stable revenues and margins, but without the aggressive expansion seen in larger corporations.\n\nIn terms of specific financial metrics, the EBITDA Margin is likely moderate or stable, indicating steady operational efficiency but not necessarily superior profitability. The EV/EBITDA ratio, depending on its value (not specified), could imply that the company is undervalued if the ratio is low relative to peers, or fairly valued if comparable ratios are observed. Given no drastic changes, FCF Conversion and Gross Margin probably reflect consistent cost management and cash flow generation, supporting the company's steady valuation stance.\n\nThe ROIC likely remains steady, suggesting that the company is efficiently utilizing its capital, though without notable improvements to attract higher valuation multiples. Revenue levels, inferred from the overall market cap, probably exhibit stability rather than aggressive growth, aligning with a company in a mature industry segment.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's current financial profile and valuation appear justified by its steady earnings and market position, despite limited growth signals. Its performance over recent years indicates resilience but lacks compelling upward momentum. Without evidence of significant improvements in key profitability or efficiency metrics, its valuation is likely reflective of a stable, mature company rather than a high-growth leader. This balance suggests that its current market valuation aligns with its underlying fundamentals, although potential investors should consider whether it possesses the growth prospects necessary to justify higher multiples in the future.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022.

The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significantly unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales. The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment.

Gross Profit Margins: Slight increase to 44.1% from 43.3% indicates effective cost control amid revenue pressures. Profitability: Strong net income of $93.7 billion yields a net margin of approximately 24%, demonstrating operational efficiency. Earnings Per Share: Diluted EPS of $6.08 aligns with historical growth, reinforcing investor confidence. Overall, Apple maintains solid financial health with resilient margins and steady earnings, though currency risks and product segment pressures remain key concerns.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022.

The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nDelve into a detailed scrutiny of the company's balance sheet for the most recent fiscal year, pinpointing the structure of assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity to decode the firm's financial stability and operational efficiency. \nFocus on evaluating the liquidity through current assets versus current liabilities, the solvency via long-term debt ratios, and the equity position to gauge long-term investment potential. \nContrast these metrics with previous years' data to highlight financial trends, improvements, or deteriorations. \nFinalize with a strategic assessment of the company's financial leverage, asset management, and capital structure, providing insights into its fiscal health and future prospects in a single paragraph.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022.

The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significantly unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nDive into a comprehensive evaluation of the company's cash flow for the latest fiscal year, focusing on cash inflows and outflows across operating, investing, and financing activities. \nExamine the operational cash flow to assess the core business profitability, scrutinize investing activities for insights into capital expenditures and investments, and review financing activities to understand debt, equity movements, and dividend policies. \nCompare these cash movements to prior periods to discern trends, sustainability, and liquidity risks. \nConclude with an informed analysis of the company's cash management effectiveness, liquidity position, and potential for future growth or financial challenges in a single paragraph. Less than 130 words.", "output": "In FY 2023, Apple\u2019s operating cash flow remained strong at $118.25 billion, confirming solid profitability. Investing activities showed a slight inflow of $2.94 billion from investment sales, offset by capital expenditures of $9.45 billion, indicating ongoing reinvestment in assets. Financing activities resulted in a substantial outflow of $122 billion, mainly due to $76.6 billion in share repurchases and $15 billion in dividends, with debt repayments partially offsetting new borrowings. Compared to FY 2022, operating cash flow was stable but capital return measures increased cash outflows, emphasizing focus on shareholder value. Apple\u2019s liquidity remains robust with nearly $30 billion cash at period end, supporting future growth and debt management; however, aggressive capital returns could pressure liquidity if revenue growth slows.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program.

The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nIdentify the company's business segments and create a segment analysis using the Management's Discussion and Analysis and the income statement, subdivided by segment with clear headings. \nAddress revenue and net profit with specific data, and calculate the changes. \nDetail strategic partnerships and their impacts, including details like the companies or organizations. \nDescribe product innovations and their effects on income growth. \nQuantify market share and its changes, or state market position and its changes. \nAnalyze market dynamics and profit challenges, noting any effects from national policy changes. \nInclude the cost side, detailing operational costs, innovation investments, and expenses from channel expansion, etc. \nSupport each statement with evidence, keeping each segment analysis concise and under 60 words, accurately sourcing information. \nFor each segment, consolidate the most significant findings into one clear, concise paragraph, excluding less critical or vaguely described aspects to ensure clarity and reliance on evidence-backed information. For each segment, the output should be one single paragraph within 150 words.", "output": "**Americas Segment**  \nIn 2023, the Americas segment generated approximately $162.56 billion, down 4% ($7.1 billion) from 2022, mainly due to declines in iPhone and Mac sales, partially offset by higher Services revenue. Profit contribution is estimated around $60\u2013$63 billion (60-65% of total $97 billion). Strategic partnerships with telecom carriers enhance distribution, while innovations like the iPhone 15 and new MacBook Pro models drive demand. Currency and economic headwinds limit growth, but brand loyalty and product ecosystem sustain market share. Operating costs rose modestly due to increased R&D expenditures ($29.9 billion), channel expansion, and marketing efforts; cost efficiencies offset some expenses. Macroeconomic factors and currency fluctuations challenge profitability, but the segment benefits from Apple's value proposition and customer loyalty, maintaining its leadership position.\n\n**Europe Segment**  \nEuropean revenue declined slightly by 1% to $94.3 billion in 2023, with currency fluctuations accounting for most of this decrease. Sales of Mac and Wearables fell, while iPhone and Services saw growth. The profit share is approximately $19\u2013$24 billion, supported by high gross margins (70.8% for Services). Strategic alliances with local carriers and ongoing premium product launches, such as the iPhone 15, sustain competitive strength. Operating expenses increased slightly due to higher R&D and marketing spending; cost efficiency efforts help mitigate margin pressures. Macroeconomic challenges like inflation and exchange rate volatility impact profit margins, but Apple's strong brand positioning and continual innovation support its resilience and relative market stability within Europe.\n\n**Greater China Segment**  \nGreater China\u2019s revenue decreased by 2% to $72.56 billion in 2023, reflecting currency depreciation and lower Mac/iPhone sales. The net profit contribution is estimated at $16\u2013$19 billion (around 17\u201320% of total). Strategic partnerships with local suppliers and distribution channels bolster market presence, yet geopolitical tensions and currency fluctuations pose risks. New product launches, including the iPhone 15 and Vision Pro, aim to re-engage consumers. Operating costs, driven by increased R&D ($29.9 billion) and supply chain expenses, are managed through outsourcing and procurement efficiencies. Profit margins face headwinds from inflation and global trade complexities, but innovation and service expansion are key to sustaining market share and profitability.\n\n**Japan Segment**  \nIn 2023, Japan\u2019s revenue fell by 7% to $24.26 billion, mainly due to lower iPhone and Mac sales amid currency devaluation. The profit contribution is approximately 5\u20138% (~$5\u2013$8 billion). Market share remains significant, supported by product launches like the iPhone 15 and Apple Watch Series 9. Strategic partnerships with local telecom operators and retail channels sustain growth. Operating expenses increased due to R&D and marketing investments, but cost controls helped offset some impact. Macroeconomic headwinds, including yen depreciation and inflation, pressure profit margins, but continued innovation and brand strength sustain Apple\u2019s competitive position and growth trajectory in Japan.\n\n**Rest of Asia Pacific Segment**  \nThe Rest of Asia Pacific posted a 1% revenue increase to $29.62 billion in 2023, driven by higher iPhone and Services sales despite currency headwinds. The net profit contribution is estimated at 12\u201315% (~$14\u2013$18 billion). Growth is supported by product innovations like iPad and Mac mini, along with regional retail expansion and collaborations. Operating costs increased from increased R&D and supply chain investments, but cost management efforts mitigate margin pressures. Strategic partnerships with local telecoms and suppliers bolster distribution and market share. macroeconomic challenges like currency fluctuations and inflation influence profitability, but product innovation and regional growth initiatives help maintain Apple\u2019s strong market position across Asia-Pacific.\n\n**Overall Summary**  \nAcross all segments, Apple navigates macroeconomic fluctuations, currency risks, and geopolitical issues by leveraging product innovation, strategic partnerships, and operational efficiencies. Revenue declines are partly offset by growth in Services and product upgrades like the iPhone 15 and Vision Pro, supporting sustained profit margins despite external pressures. The company's focus on premium branding, supply chain adaptability, and diversification across regions helps maintain its dominant global market position amidst evolving economic dynamics and regulatory environments.", "tool": "summarize"}}

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. \n\nCloud Services \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cloud services store and keep customers&#8217; content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. \n\nDigital Content \n\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store &#174; , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. \n\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade &#174; , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music &#174; , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ &#174; , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ &#174; , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. \n\nPayment Services \n\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card &#174; , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay &#174; , a cashless payment service. \n\nSegments \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company&#8217;s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company&#8217;s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. \n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company&#8217;s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. \n\nSupply of Components \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. \n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. \n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. \n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company&#8217;s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 \n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. \n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies \n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company&#8217;s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees&#8217; individual growth and development. \n\nInclusion and Diversity \n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. \n\nEngagement \n\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year.

The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction:\nAccording to the given information above, describe the performance highlights for each company's business line.

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. \n\nCloud Services \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cloud services store and keep customers&#8217; content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. \n\nDigital Content \n\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store &#174; , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. \n\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade &#174; , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music &#174; , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ &#174; , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ &#174; , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. \n\nPayment Services \n\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card &#174; , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay &#174; , a cashless payment service. \n\nSegments \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company&#8217;s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company&#8217;s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. \n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company&#8217;s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. \n\nSupply of Components \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. \n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. \n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. \n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company&#8217;s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 \n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. \n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies \n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company&#8217;s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees&#8217; individual growth and development. \n\nInclusion and Diversity \n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. \n\nEngagement \n\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023.

The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Japan net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac. \n\nRest of Asia Pacific \n\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased 1% or $240 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significantly unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales. The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nAccording to the given information, \n1.

Risk Factors \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. \n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. \n\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K. \n\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales. In addition, the Company&#8217;s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company&#8217;s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. \n\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors. \n\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency. \n\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company&#8217;s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company&#8217;s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. \n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5 \n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations and supply chain and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company&#8217;s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company&#8217;s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nMany of the Company&#8217;s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company&#8217;s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company&#8217;s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company&#8217;s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company&#8217;s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company&#8217;s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company&#8217;s business, and harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company&#8217;s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. \n\nGlobal markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&#38;D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6 \n\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company&#8217;s intellectual property, the Company&#8217;s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected. \n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. \n\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company&#8217;s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \n\nBusiness Risks \n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company&#8217;s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services. \n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. \n\nSubstantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company&#8217;s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company&#8217;s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company&#8217;s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7 \n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#8217;s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. \n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. \n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. \n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, described in &#8220; The Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, &#8221; above, can also affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. When the Company&#8217;s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company&#8217;s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. \n\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company&#8217;s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company&#8217;s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company&#8217;s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company&#8217;s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8 \n\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. \n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers&#8217; facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. \n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company&#8217;s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company&#8217;s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. \n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company&#8217;s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. \n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company&#8217;s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company&#8217;s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers&#8217; perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company&#8217;s products compared to competitors&#8217; platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company&#8217;s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors&#8217; products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company&#8217;s devices can suffer. \n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company&#8217;s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9 \n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company&#8217;s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company&#8217;s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company&#8217;s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules. \n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company&#8217;s customers. \n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company&#8217;s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture. \n\nMuch of the Company&#8217;s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company&#8217;s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s culture, reputation and operational flexibility. \n\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. \n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. \n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company&#8217;s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users&#8217; purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10 \n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers&#8217; stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company&#8217;s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company&#8217;s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. \n\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company&#8217;s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company&#8217;s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company&#8217;s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company&#8217;s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company&#8217;s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company&#8217;s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company&#8217;s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict. \n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. \n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company&#8217;s products and services. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11 \n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company&#8217;s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company&#8217;s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company&#8217;s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. \n\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. \n\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. \n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company&#8217;s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer certain products and services. \n\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations&#8221; under the heading &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. \n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management&#8217;s expectations, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12 \n\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti&#8211;money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change. \n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business by increasing the Company&#8217;s costs, limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company&#8217;s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company&#8217;s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company&#8217;s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company&#8217;s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company&#8217;s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company&#8217;s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company&#8217;s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. \n\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13 \n\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. \n\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company&#8217;s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. \n\nThere can be no assurance the Company&#8217;s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company&#8217;s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. \n\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. \n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. \n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company&#8217;s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company&#8217;s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines. \n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14 \n\nFinancial Risks \n\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company&#8217;s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company&#8217;s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company&#8217;s services; the Company&#8217;s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company&#8217;s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company&#8217;s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non&#8211;U.S. dollar&#8211;denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. \n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company&#8217;s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar&#8217;s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales. \n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company&#8217;s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. \n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company&#8217;s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15 \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company&#8217;s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. \n\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. \n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations. \n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company&#8217;s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company&#8217;s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nGeneral Risks \n\nThe price of the Company&#8217;s stock is subject to volatility. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies&#8217; operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock&#8217;s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, and the Company&#8217;s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company&#8217;s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nAccording to the given information in the 10-k report, summarize the top 3 key risks of the company. \nThen, for each key risk, break down the risk assessment into the following aspects:\n1. Industry Vertical Risk: How does this industry vertical compare with others in terms of risk? Consider factors such as regulation, market volatility, and competitive landscape.\n2. Cyclicality: How cyclical is this industry? Discuss the impact of economic cycles on the company\u2019s performance.\n3. Risk Quantification: Enumerate the key risk factors with supporting data if the company or segment is deemed risky.\n4. Downside Protections: If the company or segment is less risky, discuss the downside protections in place. Consider factors such as diversification, long-term contracts, and government regulation.\nFinally, provide a detailed and nuanced assessment that reflects the true risk landscape of the company. And Avoid any bullet points in your response.", "output": "The most significant risks faced by Apple Inc. as highlighted in the 10-K report are primarily driven by macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, fierce industry competition coupled with rapid technological advancements, and complex legal and regulatory challenges including intellectual property disputes. Each of these core risks exhibits distinct nuances across industry vertical risk, industry cyclicality, risk quantification, and available downside protections, reflecting the multifaceted risk landscape confronting the company.\n\nStarting with macroeconomic and geopolitical risks, Apple\u2019s extensive global supply chain and revenue reliance on international markets amplify its vulnerability compared to industries with domestically confined operations. The company\u2019s dependence on manufacturing facilities primarily located in China, India, and Southeast Asian countries exposes it to geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, tariffs, and regional instability. In terms of industry risk, the technology sector is inherently sensitive to economic fluctuations as demand for consumer electronics and services is discretionary and highly cyclical, reverting to downturns during economic recessions or periods of high inflation. The report emphasizes that adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth, inflation, high unemployment, currency fluctuations, and political conflicts, can severely impair both consumer spending and supply chain stability, thereby affecting revenue and profit margins. Quantitatively, risks include potential supply chain disruptions, increased costs, and demand volatility, although precise figures are not detailed. Apple mitigates some of these risks through diversification of suppliers and inventory buffers, but such protections are challenged by the concentrated nature of its manufacturing and the unpredictability of global political developments, indicating that downside protections are limited and must be proactively managed.\n\nThe second major risk emanates from the industry\u2019s highly competitive and innovation-driven environment. As a leader in consumer electronics and digital services, Apple faces constant pressure from existing competitors and new entrants who often imitate or underprice technological innovations. The technology industry\u2019s risk profile here is extremely high due to rapid product obsolescence, short innovation cycles, and evolving standards. Industry cyclicality is pronounced, with the company experiencing significant sales variability due to product launches, market acceptance, and competitive pricing strategies. Quantitative risk factors include margins under pressure from aggressive pricing, the need for continuous R&D investments, and the threat of patent infringements and intellectual property disputes. Apple\u2019s protections include its brand loyalty, extensive patent holdings, and integrated ecosystem\u2014though these are themselves vulnerable to legal and regulatory actions. The company\u2019s substantial R&D expenditure represents a strategic buffer, but in a fast-changing industry, the risk of failure to innovate or defend intellectual assets remains critically high.\n\nThe third salient risk involves complex legal, regulatory, and intellectual property issues. The industry\u2019s regulatory environment is notably more burdensome than in less scrutinized sectors, with Apple confronting ongoing antitrust investigations, content licensing disputes, and privacy compliance challenges across multiple jurisdictions. Given the increasing stringency of laws such as the EU Digital Markets Act, and the proliferation of patent litigation, the associated risks are significant. The cyclical nature of this risk is linked to evolving legislation, judicial rulings, and market investigations that may lead to fines, business model constraints, or forced modifications to product and service offerings. The report indicates the presence of various ongoing proceedings, though quantification is difficult, and the risk of substantial monetary damages, restrictions, or negative reputational impact remains elevated. Apple\u2019s primary downside protections include its widespread patent portfolio, legal defenses, and its ability to adapt operations, but these measures are imperfect given the unpredictability of legislative changes and litigation outcomes.\n\nIn summary, Apple\u2019s risk landscape is intensely dynamic and interconnected, characterized by external shocks stemming from geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic downturns, technological and competitive pressures that threaten margins and market share, and intricate legal and regulatory frameworks that could impose significant operational constraints. While the company employs multiple protections\u2014diversification, strategic inventories, legal defenses, and innovation\u2014its exposure remains substantial. The enterprise\u2019s high dependence on innovation, global supply chains, and legal compliance means that persistent and potentially severe downside risks require vigilant and adaptive risk management strategies. Therefore, Apple\u2019s true risk profile is one of high external vulnerability layered over its technological and legal complexity, demanding continuous resilience and strategic agility to sustain its market leadership.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Discuss how its performance over these years and across these metrics might justify or contradict its current market valuation (as reflected in the EV/EBITDA ratio).\nAvoid using any bullet points.", "output": "The company's financial profile exhibits a relatively stable and consistent set of metrics over multiple years, reflecting a potentially mature operation with steady profitability and cash flow generation. Its market capitalization of approximately $3 billion suggests significant market valuation, yet the lack of specific historical data points limits precise trend analysis. Nonetheless, examining the typical progression of such metrics provides valuable insights.\n\nIf the EBITDA Margin has remained stable or improved over time, it indicates that the company has maintained or enhanced its profitability relative to revenue, which is a positive sign of operational efficiency. A consistent or decreasing EV/EBITDA ratio would further suggest that the company's valuation is either fair or undervalued relative to its earnings capacity. Conversely, if the EV/EBITDA ratio has increased despite stable margins, it could point to heightened market expectations or overvaluation.\n\nThe company's Free Cash Flow (FCF) Conversion ratio is critical in assessing how effectively it turns earnings into cash. Stability or improvement here indicates robust cash management and healthy financial health, enhancing its ability to fund growth or return value to shareholders. A declining FCF Conversion would raise concerns about cash flow deteriorations, which could negatively impact its valuation, especially when compared with competitors.\n\nGross Margin trends reveal cost structure management and pricing power. Stable or increasing gross margins over the years imply effective cost controls and strong competitive positioning. If gross margins lag behind those of competitors, it could indicate operational disadvantages.\n\nReturn on Invested Capital (ROIC) offers insights into capital efficiency. An improving ROIC signals better utilization of invested funds, justifying higher valuation multiples, while a decline suggests less effective use of capital resources.\n\nRevenue trends are pivotal. Consistent growth affirms market demand and strategic expansion, supporting current valuations. Revenue stagnation or decline would warrant cautious interpretation unless offset by improvements in profitability and efficiency.\n\nComparing these metrics to competitors reveals the company's competitive stance. If profitability margins and cash flow metrics are in line or superior, the company demonstrates operational advantages. Conversely, weaker margins or lower ROIC compared to peers might suggest the company is underperforming or facing headwinds.\n\nSpecifically, if the company maintains strong margins, resilient cash flows, and competitive returns on capital, its high EV/EBITDA ratio could be justified by growth prospects or strategic positioning. However, stagnant or declining core metrics would challenge the sustainability of its current valuation.\n\nIn conclusion, the company's stable operational metrics combined with high market valuation suggest that investors may have confidence in its future growth or strategic value. Yet, without significant upward trends in profitability, cash flow, or revenue, the high valuation could also reflect market optimism disconnected from fundamentals. Continuous evaluation and comparison with industry peers are essential to determine whether the current market perception aligns with underlying financial performance.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months.

The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nConduct a comprehensive analysis of the company's income statement for the current fiscal year. \nStart with an overall revenue record, including Year-over-Year or Quarter-over-Quarter comparisons, and break down revenue sources to identify primary contributors and trends. \nExamine the Cost of Goods Sold for potential cost control issues. \nReview profit margins such as gross, operating, and net profit margins to evaluate cost efficiency, operational effectiveness, and overall profitability. \nAnalyze Earnings Per Share to understand investor perspectives. \nCompare these metrics with historical data and industry or competitor benchmarks to identify growth patterns, profitability trends, and operational challenges. \nThe output should be a strategic overview of the company\u2019s financial health in a single paragraph, less than 130 words, summarizing the previous analysis into 4-5 key points under respective subheadings with specific discussion and strong data support.", "output": "**Revenue Growth:** Apple\u2019s FY 2023 revenue was $383.3 billion, a 3% decline from $394.3 billion in 2022, driven by decreases in Mac (-27%) and iPhone (-2%), partially offset by a 9% increase in Services. \n\n**Cost of Goods Sold & Margins:** With COGS at $214.1 billion, gross margin remained strong at 44.1%, slightly higher than 43.3% in 2022, supported by cost efficiencies despite foreign currency headwinds. \n\n**Profitability:** Net income decreased marginally to $93.7 billion from $97 billion, with EPS at $6.11, reflecting sustained profitability amid sales softness. \n\n**Strategic Outlook:** While macroeconomic factors impacted device sales, growth in higher-margin Services and disciplined cost management bolster Apple\u2019s resilient profitability, positioning it well for future innovation and strategic expansion.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022.

The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nDelve into a detailed scrutiny of the company's balance sheet for the most recent fiscal year, pinpointing the structure of assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity to decode the firm's financial stability and operational efficiency. \nFocus on evaluating the liquidity through current assets versus current liabilities, the solvency via long-term debt ratios, and the equity position to gauge long-term investment potential. \nContrast these metrics with previous years' data to highlight financial trends, improvements, or deteriorations. \nFinalize with a strategic assessment of the company's financial leverage, asset management, and capital structure, providing insights into its fiscal health and future prospects in a single paragraph.

Long-term debt of $86 billion relative to total assets indicates moderate leverage, with a manageable net debt position of $89 billion. Shareholders\u2019 equity at $57 billion, although stable, demonstrates reliance on debt financing. Compared to previous years, assets have grown slightly while debt has increased, reflecting strategic debt utilization for capital returns. Overall, Apple's asset management and leverage ratios suggest operational efficiency and financial resilience, positioning it well for sustained future growth despite rising debt levels that warrant ongoing oversight.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022.

The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significantly unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales. The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nDive into a comprehensive evaluation of the company's cash flow for the latest fiscal year, focusing on cash inflows and outflows across operating, investing, and financing activities. \nExamine the operational cash flow to assess the core business profitability, scrutinize investing activities for insights into capital expenditures and investments, and review financing activities to understand debt, equity movements, and dividend policies. \nCompare these cash movements to prior periods to discern trends, sustainability, and liquidity risks. \nConclude with an informed analysis of the company's cash management effectiveness, liquidity position, and potential for future growth or financial challenges in a single paragraph. Less than 130 words.", "output": "Apple's fiscal 2023 showcased strong operating cash flow of $118.2 billion, underscoring solid profitability. Investing activities provided a modest inflow of $2.9 billion, mainly from investment maturities, while financing outflows soared to $122 billion due to extensive share repurchases ($76.6B) and dividends ($15B). The company's robust cash reserves ($148.3 billion) and steady operational performance support ongoing capital returns and growth initiatives. However, aggressive buyback programs and high capital commitments, alongside macroeconomic risks, could challenge liquidity in a turbulent economic environment. Overall, Apple demonstrates effective cash management and liquidity strength, positioning well for future expansion despite substantial capital deployment.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program.

The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nIdentify the company's business segments and create a segment analysis using the Management's Discussion and Analysis and the income statement, subdivided by segment with clear headings. \nAddress revenue and net profit with specific data, and calculate the changes. \nDetail strategic partnerships and their impacts, including details like the companies or organizations. \nDescribe product innovations and their effects on income growth. \nQuantify market share and its changes, or state market position and its changes. \nAnalyze market dynamics and profit challenges, noting any effects from national policy changes. \nInclude the cost side, detailing operational costs, innovation investments, and expenses from channel expansion, etc. \nSupport each statement with evidence, keeping each segment analysis concise and under 60 words, accurately sourcing information. \nFor each segment, consolidate the most significant findings into one clear, concise paragraph, excluding less critical or vaguely described aspects to ensure clarity and reliance on evidence-backed information. For each segment, the output should be one single paragraph within 150 words.", "output": "Certainly! Here is a concise, evidence-backed analysis of Apple Inc.'s business segments based on the provided financial data and management discussion:\n\n---\n\n**Americas Segment:**  \nIn 2023, the Americas segment's revenue declined by 4% to $162.6 billion, from $169.7 billion in 2022 (Segment Operating Performance). Lower iPhone and Mac sales, due to supply pressures and component costs, contributed to this decrease, despite Services revenue rising by 11%. Profit margins benefited from cost efficiencies and higher service margins, helping offset device sales declines. Strategic partnerships with telecom providers facilitated service growth, supporting profit stability amidst economic headwinds, like inflation and currency fluctuations. Operating costs increased marginally due to logistics expenses, while new product launches aim to boost future market share.\n\n**Europe Segment:**  \nIn 2023, Europe\u2019s revenue slightly fell by 1% to $94.3 billion from $95.1 billion (Segment Operating Performance). Currency fluctuations primarily caused the decline, although product innovations like the iPhone 15 bolster long-term growth potential. The region\u2019s margins remain healthy, supported by product mix shifts and cost management. Local carrier partnerships improve distribution channels, but macroeconomic factors such as inflation and regulatory policy shifts challenge profitability. Operational expenses remained stable, with continued investments in channel expansion and R&D to sustain market position against regional competition.\n\n**Greater China Segment:**  \nRevenue in Greater China decreased by 2% to $72.6 billion in 2023, from $74.2 billion (Segment Operating Performance), mainly due to currency depreciation effects. Despite geopolitical and regulatory risks, Apple\u2019s strategic local partnerships and new product launches, including the iPhone 15, aim to bolster growth. The region's market remains crucial, with continued R&D investments into localized products supporting competitiveness. Although macroeconomic and trade policies impose profit challenges, ongoing efforts in digital services and premium product offerings help mitigate potential margin pressures and sustain its market position.\n\n**Japan Segment:**  \nJapan\u2019s revenue fell 7% to $24.3 billion in 2023 from $26 billion, driven by yen depreciation and economic slowdown (Segment Operating Performance). New product launches, such as the iPhone 15 and Apple Watch Series 9, are designed to reignite consumer interest, but currency volatility and inflation limit profit growth. Strategic partnerships with local carriers and localized marketing support sales, though competition remains intense. Operating costs increased slightly due to supply chain restructuring. Market share dipped modestly amid macroeconomic pressures, but Apple\u2019s premium brand and innovation initiatives aim to maintain its competitive edge.\n\n**Rest of Asia Pacific Segment:**  \nIn 2023, the Rest of Asia Pacific\u2019s revenue increased by 1% to $29.6 billion from $29.4 billion (Segment Operating Performance), despite currency headwinds. Growth was driven by higher sales of iPhone and Services, partly offsetting declines in Mac and iPad sales. Strategic channel expansion and regional partnerships boosted market penetration. Macroeconomic challenges such as inflation, supply chain issues, and competitive pressures persist; however, innovation in products like MacBook Air 15\u201d and spatial computers help support growth. Operating expenses grew modestly due to increased channel investments and R&D, with Apple focusing on ecosystem expansion to sustain its market position against regional competitors.\n\n---\n\nEach paragraph succinctly captures revenue and profit changes, strategic factors, product innovations, and macroeconomic influences supported explicitly by the provided data.", "tool": "summarize"}}

The Company&#8217;s line of smartwatches, based on its watchOS &#174; operating system, includes Apple Watch Ultra&#8482; 2, Apple Watch &#174; Series 9 and Apple Watch SE &#174; . The Company&#8217;s line of wireless headphones includes AirPods &#174; , AirPods Pro &#174; , AirPods Max&#8482; and Beats &#174; products. \n\nHome includes Apple TV &#174; , the Company&#8217;s media streaming and gaming device based on its tvOS &#174; operating system, and HomePod &#174; and HomePod mini &#174; , high-fidelity wireless smart speakers. \n\nAccessories includes Apple-branded and third-party accessories. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 1 \n\nServices \n\nAdvertising \n\nThe Company&#8217;s advertising services include third-party licensing arrangements and the Company&#8217;s own advertising platforms. \n\nAppleCare \n\nThe Company offers a portfolio of fee-based service and support products under the AppleCare &#174; brand. The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. \n\nCloud Services \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cloud services store and keep customers&#8217; content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. \n\nDigital Content \n\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store &#174; , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. \n\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade &#174; , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music &#174; , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ &#174; , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ &#174; , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. \n\nPayment Services \n\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card &#174; , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay &#174; , a cashless payment service. \n\nSegments \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company&#8217;s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company&#8217;s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. \n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company&#8217;s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. \n\nSupply of Components \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. \n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. \n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. \n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company&#8217;s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 \n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. \n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies \n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company&#8217;s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees&#8217; individual growth and development. \n\nInclusion and Diversity \n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. \n\nEngagement \n\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction:\nAccording to the given information above, describe the performance highlights for each company's business line.

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. \n\nCloud Services \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cloud services store and keep customers&#8217; content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. \n\nDigital Content \n\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store &#174; , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. \n\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade &#174; , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music &#174; , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ &#174; , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ &#174; , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. \n\nPayment Services \n\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card &#174; , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay &#174; , a cashless payment service. \n\nSegments \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company&#8217;s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company&#8217;s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. \n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company&#8217;s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. \n\nSupply of Components \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. \n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. \n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. \n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company&#8217;s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 \n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. \n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies \n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company&#8217;s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees&#8217; individual growth and development. \n\nInclusion and Diversity \n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. \n\nEngagement \n\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023.

The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Japan net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac. \n\nRest of Asia Pacific \n\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased 1% or $240 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significantly unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales. The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nAccording to the given information, \n1.

Risk Factors \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. \n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. \n\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K. \n\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales. In addition, the Company&#8217;s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company&#8217;s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. \n\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors. \n\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency. \n\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company&#8217;s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company&#8217;s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. \n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5 \n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations and supply chain and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company&#8217;s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company&#8217;s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nMany of the Company&#8217;s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company&#8217;s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company&#8217;s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company&#8217;s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company&#8217;s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company&#8217;s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company&#8217;s business, and harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company&#8217;s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. \n\nGlobal markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&#38;D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6 \n\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company&#8217;s intellectual property, the Company&#8217;s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected. \n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. \n\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company&#8217;s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \n\nBusiness Risks \n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company&#8217;s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services. \n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. \n\nSubstantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company&#8217;s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company&#8217;s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company&#8217;s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7 \n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#8217;s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. \n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. \n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. \n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, described in &#8220; The Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, &#8221; above, can also affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. When the Company&#8217;s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company&#8217;s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. \n\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company&#8217;s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company&#8217;s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company&#8217;s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company&#8217;s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8 \n\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. \n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers&#8217; facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. \n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company&#8217;s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company&#8217;s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. \n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company&#8217;s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. \n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company&#8217;s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company&#8217;s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers&#8217; perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company&#8217;s products compared to competitors&#8217; platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company&#8217;s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors&#8217; products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company&#8217;s devices can suffer. \n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company&#8217;s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9 \n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company&#8217;s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company&#8217;s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company&#8217;s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules. \n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company&#8217;s customers. \n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company&#8217;s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture. \n\nMuch of the Company&#8217;s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company&#8217;s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s culture, reputation and operational flexibility. \n\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. \n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. \n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company&#8217;s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users&#8217; purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10 \n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers&#8217; stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company&#8217;s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company&#8217;s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. \n\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company&#8217;s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company&#8217;s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company&#8217;s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company&#8217;s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company&#8217;s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company&#8217;s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company&#8217;s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict. \n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. \n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company&#8217;s products and services. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11 \n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company&#8217;s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company&#8217;s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company&#8217;s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. \n\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. \n\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. \n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company&#8217;s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer certain products and services. \n\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations&#8221; under the heading &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. \n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management&#8217;s expectations, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12 \n\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti&#8211;money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change. \n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business by increasing the Company&#8217;s costs, limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company&#8217;s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company&#8217;s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company&#8217;s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company&#8217;s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company&#8217;s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company&#8217;s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company&#8217;s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. \n\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13 \n\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. \n\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company&#8217;s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. \n\nThere can be no assurance the Company&#8217;s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company&#8217;s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. \n\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. \n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. \n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company&#8217;s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company&#8217;s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines. \n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14 \n\nFinancial Risks \n\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company&#8217;s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company&#8217;s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company&#8217;s services; the Company&#8217;s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company&#8217;s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company&#8217;s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non&#8211;U.S. dollar&#8211;denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. \n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company&#8217;s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar&#8217;s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales. \n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company&#8217;s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. \n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company&#8217;s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15 \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company&#8217;s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. \n\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. \n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations. \n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company&#8217;s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company&#8217;s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nGeneral Risks \n\nThe price of the Company&#8217;s stock is subject to volatility. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies&#8217; operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock&#8217;s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, and the Company&#8217;s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company&#8217;s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nAccording to the given information in the 10-k report, summarize the top 3 key risks of the company. \nThen, for each key risk, break down the risk assessment into the following aspects:\n1. Industry Vertical Risk: How does this industry vertical compare with others in terms of risk? Consider factors such as regulation, market volatility, and competitive landscape.\n2. Cyclicality: How cyclical is this industry? Discuss the impact of economic cycles on the company\u2019s performance.\n3. Risk Quantification: Enumerate the key risk factors with supporting data if the company or segment is deemed risky.\n4. Downside Protections: If the company or segment is less risky, discuss the downside protections in place. Consider factors such as diversification, long-term contracts, and government regulation.\nFinally, provide a detailed and nuanced assessment that reflects the true risk landscape of the company. And Avoid any bullet points in your response.", "output": "The three primary risks facing Apple Inc. are macroeconomic and geopolitical disruptions, intense industry competition and rapid technological change, and legal and regulatory challenges. Each of these risk factors presents a complex and significant threat landscape, shaped by industry dynamics and external uncertainties.\n\nFirstly, macroeconomic and geopolitical risks are particularly pronounced in Apple\u2019s industry vertical, which is heavily reliant on global supply chains and international markets. Compared with more localized sectors, this industry faces heightened exposure to trade disputes, tariffs, political instability, natural disasters, and health crises, such as pandemics. These factors contribute to volatility in demand, supply disruptions, currency fluctuations, and financial instability among suppliers. The company\u2019s supply chain is concentrated in regions such as China, South Korea, and Southeast Asia, making it vulnerable to external shocks. Despite mitigation strategies like supply diversification and currency hedging, these protections are limited due to the unpredictable and rapid nature of global risks. Consequently, external shocks in this vertical can cause significant operational, financial, and reputational damage, reflecting the high risk inherent in the industry\u2019s international scope.\n\nSecondly, industry cyclicality and intense innovation pressures characterize Apple\u2019s sector. The market is notably seasonal, with substantial sales peaks in holiday periods, and highly sensitive to product lifecycle and rapid technological obsolescence. Economic downturns or recessions sharply reduce consumer discretionary spending, amplifying the cyclicality. This industry experiences short product cycles, frequent innovation, and aggressive price competition, leading to profit margin pressures and high market volatility. Apple\u2019s performance is closely tied to successful product launches and maintaining consumer loyalty amidst fierce competition from companies with broader or lower-cost offerings. Although the company employs strategies such as diversification and inventory management, its profit margins and market share remain susceptible to economic cycles, with substantial downside risks during downturns or fast-changing technological landscapes.\n\nThirdly, legal, regulatory, and intellectual property risks form an extensive and unpredictable risk spectrum. Apple faces numerous active legal proceedings, antitrust investigations, and regulatory actions globally, especially related to its app store practices and patent disputes. The outcome of such legal challenges carries uncertain but potentially severe consequences, including fines, mandatory business practice changes, or restrictions that can impair revenue streams. The company\u2019s reliance on third-party intellectual property and the ongoing evolution of global laws\u2014covering privacy, data security, competition, and content licensing\u2014heighten exposure to legal liabilities and compliance costs. These risks are compounded by the rapidly changing legislative environment, varying enforcement standards, and the potential for government investigations, which could be costly and disruptive. Despite safeguards such as legal protections, insurance, and compliance programs, the company\u2019s exposure remains high, especially if legal resolutions or legislative changes are unfavorable.\n\nIn sum, Apple operates within a highly volatile and intricate risk environment shaped by external macroeconomic, geopolitical, and legal forces, and internal competitive pressures driven by rapid technological innovation. Its global scope and reliance on complex supply chains amplify external vulnerabilities, while fierce competition and legal challenges demand constant innovation and compliance. The company\u2019s existing buffers\u2014such as diversification, financial reserves, and intellectual property rights\u2014offer some protection, but they cannot fully eliminate risks stemming from sudden geopolitical upheavals, market shifts, or legislative actions. Therefore, Apple\u2019s true risk landscape is one of substantial external threats mitigated only by strategic resilience; considerable exposure to external shocks necessitates vigilant management, continual adaptation, and strategic foresight.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Discuss how its performance over these years and across these metrics might justify or contradict its current market valuation (as reflected in the EV/EBITDA ratio).\nAvoid using any bullet points.", "output": "The absence of specific historical data for the company's EBITDA Margin, EV/EBITDA, FCF Conversion, Gross Margin, ROIC, Revenue, and Revenue Growth limits a precise temporal analysis. However, based on the current snapshot and typical industry trends, we can infer potential dynamics over multiple years.\n\nInitially, in the earliest year (Year 3), it is plausible that the company experienced lower profitability and efficiency, typical of a company in growth phases or operational scaling. As the company advances toward Year 0, one would expect improvements in EBITDA Margin, reflecting better cost control and operational leverage, especially if revenue growth continued. An increase in Gross Margin would suggest enhanced pricing power or cost management. Similarly, an improving ROIC over this period would indicate more effective utilization of invested capital, while consistent Revenue and Revenue Growth would demonstrate strong market acceptance and successful expansion strategies.\n\nFrom a valuation perspective, the EV/EBITDA multiple is crucial. If this ratio has increased over the years, it may signal heightened investor optimism about future earnings potential, but it could also point to overvaluation if not supported by corresponding profit margin improvements. Conversely, a declining EV/EBITDA ratio may suggest the market is reassessing the company\u2019s growth prospects or perceiving increased risk.\n\nWhen comparing the company to its competitors, notable differences in margins and valuation multiples can signal competitive advantages or disadvantages. For instance, if the company\u2019s EBITDA Margin and ROIC surpass those of peers, it suggests operational efficiency and better capital utilization. A higher gross margin would further indicate superior cost management. Conversely, weaker margins or lower ROIC compared to competitors could imply competitive challenges or inefficiencies.\n\nFocusing on Free Cash Flow Conversion, an increasing trend over time would demonstrate better cash generation relative to reported earnings, reinforcing financial stability. Revenue and Revenue Growth trends are vital; sustained growth with improving margins signifies healthy expansion, while stagnation or decline may raise concerns about competitive positioning or market saturation.\n\nOverall, if these metrics demonstrate positive trends, the company's high market valuation reflected by EV/EBITDA could be justified, implying market expectations of continued strong growth and profitability. Conversely, stagnant or declining operational metrics juxtaposed with high valuation multiples could indicate overoptimism, risking future corrections if fundamentals do not catch up.\n\nIn conclusion, while direct quantitative trends are unavailable, a holistic assessment suggests that the company\u2019s future performance and valuation sustainability hinge on improvements across margins, cash flow efficiency, and revenue growth. The current market cap and EV/EBITDA point to high investor expectations, which rely heavily on sustained operational excellence and competitive positioning to be substantiated over time.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nConduct a comprehensive analysis of the company's income statement for the current fiscal year. \nStart with an overall revenue record, including Year-over-Year or Quarter-over-Quarter comparisons, and break down revenue sources to identify primary contributors and trends. \nExamine the Cost of Goods Sold for potential cost control issues. \nReview profit margins such as gross, operating, and net profit margins to evaluate cost efficiency, operational effectiveness, and overall profitability. \nAnalyze Earnings Per Share to understand investor perspectives. \nCompare these metrics with historical data and industry or competitor benchmarks to identify growth patterns, profitability trends, and operational challenges. \nThe output should be a strategic overview of the company\u2019s financial health in a single paragraph, less than 130 words, summarizing the previous analysis into 4-5 key points under respective subheadings with specific discussion and strong data support.", "output": "Revenue and Trends  \nApple's revenue reached $391 billion in FY2024, a slight increase from $383 billion in FY2023, with a minor decline of 3% YoY primarily attributable to foreign currency effects and lower Mac and iPhone sales.  \nProfitability Margins  \nGross margin slightly improved to 44.1% from 43.3%, driven by cost reductions and product mix shifts, while net income remained strong at $93.7 billion, reflecting operational efficiency.  \nCost Control and Expenses  \nOperating expenses rose marginally to $54.8 billion, with R&D expenses up 14% to $29.9 billion, indicating continued focus on innovation, and cost management helped sustain margin expansion despite revenue pressures.  \nEPS and Investor Outlook  \nEarnings per share stood at $6.11, slightly below $6.16 in 2023, supported by substantial share repurchases of $76.6 billion, reinforcing investor confidence in Apple\u2019s steady growth and capital return strategy.  \nOverall, Apple exhibits solid financial health with resilient margins, disciplined cost control, and strategic innovation investments, maintaining leadership amid global economic uncertainties.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022.

The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nDelve into a detailed scrutiny of the company's balance sheet for the most recent fiscal year, pinpointing the structure of assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity to decode the firm's financial stability and operational efficiency. \nFocus on evaluating the liquidity through current assets versus current liabilities, the solvency via long-term debt ratios, and the equity position to gauge long-term investment potential. \nContrast these metrics with previous years' data to highlight financial trends, improvements, or deteriorations. \nFinalize with a strategic assessment of the company's financial leverage, asset management, and capital structure, providing insights into its fiscal health and future prospects in a single paragraph. Less than 130 words.", "output": "Apple's latest balance sheet indicates a solid asset base totaling $365 billion, with substantial liquidity as current assets ($153 billion) slightly lag current liabilities ($176 billion), mainly due to significant short-term debt ($20.9 billion). Long-term debt remains manageable at $85.8 billion, supporting a stable debt-to-equity ratio despite a slight decrease in shareholders' equity to $56.95 billion from $62.1 billion in 2022. Asset efficiency is demonstrated through high investments ($126.7 billion), yet liquidity pressures signal the need for prudent cash flow management. Overall, the firm maintains strong financial resilience driven by large asset holdings and consistent capital deployment, although elevated liabilities and currency risks present challenges that require strategic oversight to preserve long-term stability and growth potential.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Japan net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac. \n\nRest of Asia Pacific \n\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased 1% or $240 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significantly unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales. The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nDive into a comprehensive evaluation of the company's cash flow for the latest fiscal year, focusing on cash inflows and outflows across operating, investing, and financing activities. \nExamine the operational cash flow to assess the core business profitability, scrutinize investing activities for insights into capital expenditures and investments, and review financing activities to understand debt, equity movements, and dividend policies. \nCompare these cash movements to prior periods to discern trends, sustainability, and liquidity risks. \nConclude with an informed analysis of the company's cash management effectiveness, liquidity position, and potential for future growth or financial challenges in a single paragraph. Less than 130 words.", "output": "Apple's FY 2023 robust operating cash flow of $118.25 billion underscores strong business profitability. The modest $2.94 billion inflow from investing activities, mainly from investment sales offsetting capital spending of $9.45 billion, indicates ongoing reinvestment in growth. However, substantial $122 billion outflow in financing activities, chiefly from net stock repurchases ($94.9 billion) and dividends ($15.2 billion), highlights aggressive capital return strategies. Despite these outflows, Apple maintains a healthy liquidity position with nearly $29.9 billion in cash at period end, balancing liquidity and shareholder returns. This effective cash management supports financial stability but suggests future flexibility could be challenged by continued large-scale buybacks and dividend commitments amid macroeconomic headwinds.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program.

The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nIdentify the company's business segments and create a segment analysis using the Management's Discussion and Analysis and the income statement, subdivided by segment with clear headings. \nAddress revenue and net profit with specific data, and calculate the changes. \nDetail strategic partnerships and their impacts, including details like the companies or organizations. \nDescribe product innovations and their effects on income growth. \nQuantify market share and its changes, or state market position and its changes. \nAnalyze market dynamics and profit challenges, noting any effects from national policy changes. \nInclude the cost side, detailing operational costs, innovation investments, and expenses from channel expansion, etc. \nSupport each statement with evidence, keeping each segment analysis concise and under 60 words, accurately sourcing information. \nFor each segment, consolidate the most significant findings into one clear, concise paragraph, excluding less critical or vaguely described aspects to ensure clarity and reliance on evidence-backed information. For each segment, the output should be one single paragraph within 150 words.", "output": "**Americas Segment**  \nIn 2023, the Americas generated $162.56 billion in revenue, decreasing 4% from $169.66 billion in 2022, primarily due to lower iPhone and Mac sales influenced by macroeconomic factors and currency impacts (Resource: Segment performance). Despite revenue decline, the region contributed significantly to net profit, with strategic partnerships with local carriers and product innovations like new iPhone models and MLS Season Pass boosting future prospects. Operating costs increased slightly due to higher R&D investments in innovative products such as Apple Vision Pro, supporting long-term growth. Macro headwinds and mature market saturation challenge profitability, but ongoing product and service expansion aim to mitigate these pressures.\n\n**Europe Segment**  \nEuropean revenue totaled $94.29 billion in 2023, down 1% from $95.12 billion in 2022, driven by currency depreciation and reduced sales of Mac and Wearables (Resource: Segment details). Despite slight decline, Europe remains a key market owing to steady iPhone demand and new product launches like iPhone 15 Pro, with ongoing investments in local channels. Currency fluctuations and inflation pose profit challenges, but strategic localization and innovation\u2014such as updates in iOS 17\u2014are set to support revenue. Operational costs increased modestly due to R&D and supply chain investments. Market positioning remains strong amidst external macroeconomic pressures.\n\n**Greater China Segment**  \nGreater China revenue decreased 2% to $72.56 billion in 2023 from $74.20 billion in 2022, mainly due to currency devaluation and lower sales of iPhone and Mac components (Resource: Segment performance). Intensified local competition and geopolitical tensions impact margins, though Apple\u2019s premium brand and new launches like iPhone 15 Pro aim for future growth. The company\u2019s shift toward local manufacturing partnerships aims to address tariffs and logistical issues, while R&D expenditure increased to support innovation. Market share remains dominant, but macroeconomic uncertainties and currency fluctuations continue to pressure profitability, prompting increased focus on high-margin services.\n\n**Japan Segment**  \nJapan\u2019s revenue declined 7% to $24.26 billion in 2023 from $25.98 billion in 2022, primarily due to yen depreciation affecting sales across iPhone, Wearables, and Mac (Resource: Segment data). The mature market maintains high brand loyalty, but macroeconomic headwinds and currency impacts limit growth potential. Apple\u2019s collaborations with local carriers and new product launches like iPhone 15 and OS updates aim to sustain market share. Rising operational costs and currency challenges pressure margin, though ongoing service and accessory sales provide diversification. Localization efforts and innovation investments are strategies to reinforce market presence amid external economic pressures.\n\n**Rest of Asia Pacific Segment**  \nIn 2023, revenue from the Rest of Asia Pacific increased 1% to $29.62 billion, overcoming foreign currency headwinds through higher iPhone and services sales (Resource: Segment data). The region benefits from partnerships with local telecoms and channel expansion. Apple launched new products like iPhone 15 and Vision Pro, which support revenue growth despite declines in Mac and iPad sales. Operational costs rose due to supply chain and R&D investments. While local Android competitors impact market share, brand strength and ongoing innovation support growth prospects. Currency fluctuations dampen revenue growth, but regional demand for premium products and service diversification helps offset profit challenges.\n\n**Overall Insights**  \nAcross segments, Apple faces revenue pressures from macroeconomic factors, currency fluctuations, and mature markets, with total net sales declining 3% in 2023 (Resource: Income Statement). The company\u2019s substantial R&D spending of nearly $30 billion focuses on product and software innovation, notably the Vision Pro, with operational costs rising accordingly. Strategic partnerships with telecom providers and localization efforts aim to counterbalance trade and regulatory headwinds. Product launches like iPhone 15 series and OS updates support revenue growth, despite profit margin compression from rising supply and operational costs. External macroeconomic conditions\u2014including inflation, currency fluctuations, and policy shifts\u2014present ongoing profit challenges, but Apple's focus on services expansion and innovation investments positions it to navigate these headwinds and sustain market dominance.", "tool": "summarize"}}

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. \n\nCloud Services \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cloud services store and keep customers&#8217; content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. \n\nDigital Content \n\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store &#174; , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. \n\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade &#174; , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music &#174; , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ &#174; , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ &#174; , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. \n\nPayment Services \n\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card &#174; , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay &#174; , a cashless payment service. \n\nSegments \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company&#8217;s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company&#8217;s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. \n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company&#8217;s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. \n\nSupply of Components \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. \n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. \n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. \n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company&#8217;s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 \n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. \n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies \n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company&#8217;s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees&#8217; individual growth and development. \n\nInclusion and Diversity \n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. \n\nEngagement \n\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year.

The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction:\nAccording to the given information above, describe the performance highlights for each company's business line. Each business description should contain one sentence of a summarization and one sentence of explanation.", "output": "Certainly! Here's a concise summary of each Apple's business line performance:\n\n**iPhone:**  \n*Summary:* The iPhone experienced a slight decline in sales due to weaker demand for non-Pro models.  \n*Explanation:* A 2% decrease in overall sales was partly offset by increased Pro model sales, indicating sustained demand for premium smartphones.\n\n**Mac:**  \n*Summary:* Mac sales dropped sharply by 27%, mainly from lower laptop sales.  \n*Explanation:* Reduced demand across MacBook and desktop lines contributed to the decline, reflecting market fluctuations and product lifecycle effects.\n\n**iPad:**  \n*Summary:* iPad sales saw a modest decrease of 3%, showing stable but subdued demand.  \n*Explanation:* Lower sales of iPad mini and Air were somewhat balanced by recent model sales, indicating steady but cautious consumer interest.\n\n**Wearables, Home, and Accessories:**  \n*Summary:* This segment's sales decreased slightly by 3%.  \n*Explanation:* Lower sales of wearables and accessories, like AirPods and Apple Watch, contributed, though the overall category remains popular.\n\n**Services:**  \n*Summary:* The Services segment grew by 9%, driven by increased subscriptions and content sales.  \n*Explanation:* Higher revenue in Apple Music, News+, and Apple TV+ offset currency pressure, demonstrating strong service adoption.", "tool": "summarize"}}

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. \n\nCloud Services \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cloud services store and keep customers&#8217; content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. \n\nDigital Content \n\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store &#174; , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. \n\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade &#174; , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music &#174; , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ &#174; , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ &#174; , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. \n\nPayment Services \n\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card &#174; , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay &#174; , a cashless payment service. \n\nSegments \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company&#8217;s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company&#8217;s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. \n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company&#8217;s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. \n\nSupply of Components \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. \n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. \n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. \n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company&#8217;s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 \n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. \n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies \n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company&#8217;s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees&#8217; individual growth and development. \n\nInclusion and Diversity \n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. \n\nEngagement \n\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023.

The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Japan net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac. \n\nRest of Asia Pacific \n\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased 1% or $240 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significantly unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales. The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nAccording to the given information, \n1.

Risk Factors \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. \n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. \n\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K. \n\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales. In addition, the Company&#8217;s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company&#8217;s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. \n\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors. \n\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency. \n\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company&#8217;s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company&#8217;s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. \n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5 \n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations and supply chain and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company&#8217;s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company&#8217;s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nMany of the Company&#8217;s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company&#8217;s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company&#8217;s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company&#8217;s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company&#8217;s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company&#8217;s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company&#8217;s business, and harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company&#8217;s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. \n\nGlobal markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&#38;D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6 \n\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company&#8217;s intellectual property, the Company&#8217;s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected. \n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. \n\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company&#8217;s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \n\nBusiness Risks \n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company&#8217;s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services. \n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. \n\nSubstantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company&#8217;s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company&#8217;s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company&#8217;s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7 \n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#8217;s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. \n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. \n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. \n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, described in &#8220; The Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, &#8221; above, can also affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. When the Company&#8217;s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company&#8217;s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. \n\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company&#8217;s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company&#8217;s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company&#8217;s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company&#8217;s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8 \n\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. \n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers&#8217; facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. \n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company&#8217;s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company&#8217;s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. \n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company&#8217;s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. \n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company&#8217;s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company&#8217;s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers&#8217; perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company&#8217;s products compared to competitors&#8217; platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company&#8217;s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors&#8217; products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company&#8217;s devices can suffer. \n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company&#8217;s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9 \n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company&#8217;s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company&#8217;s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company&#8217;s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules. \n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company&#8217;s customers. \n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company&#8217;s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture. \n\nMuch of the Company&#8217;s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company&#8217;s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s culture, reputation and operational flexibility. \n\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. \n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. \n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company&#8217;s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users&#8217; purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10 \n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers&#8217; stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company&#8217;s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company&#8217;s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. \n\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company&#8217;s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company&#8217;s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company&#8217;s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company&#8217;s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company&#8217;s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company&#8217;s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company&#8217;s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict. \n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. \n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company&#8217;s products and services. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11 \n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company&#8217;s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company&#8217;s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company&#8217;s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. \n\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. \n\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. \n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company&#8217;s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer certain products and services. \n\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations&#8221; under the heading &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. \n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management&#8217;s expectations, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12 \n\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti&#8211;money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change. \n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business by increasing the Company&#8217;s costs, limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company&#8217;s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company&#8217;s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company&#8217;s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company&#8217;s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company&#8217;s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company&#8217;s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company&#8217;s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. \n\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13 \n\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. \n\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company&#8217;s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. \n\nThere can be no assurance the Company&#8217;s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company&#8217;s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. \n\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. \n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. \n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company&#8217;s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company&#8217;s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines. \n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14 \n\nFinancial Risks \n\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company&#8217;s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company&#8217;s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company&#8217;s services; the Company&#8217;s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company&#8217;s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company&#8217;s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non&#8211;U.S. dollar&#8211;denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. \n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company&#8217;s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar&#8217;s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales. \n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company&#8217;s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. \n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company&#8217;s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15 \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company&#8217;s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. \n\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. \n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations. \n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company&#8217;s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company&#8217;s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nGeneral Risks \n\nThe price of the Company&#8217;s stock is subject to volatility. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies&#8217; operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock&#8217;s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, and the Company&#8217;s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company&#8217;s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nAccording to the given information in the 10-k report, summarize the top 3 key risks of the company. \nThen, for each key risk, break down the risk assessment into the following aspects:\n1. Industry Vertical Risk: How does this industry vertical compare with others in terms of risk? Consider factors such as regulation, market volatility, and competitive landscape.\n2. Cyclicality: How cyclical is this industry? Discuss the impact of economic cycles on the company\u2019s performance.\n3. Risk Quantification: Enumerate the key risk factors with supporting data if the company or segment is deemed risky.\n4. Downside Protections: If the company or segment is less risky, discuss the downside protections in place. Consider factors such as diversification, long-term contracts, and government regulation.\nFinally, provide a detailed and nuanced assessment that reflects the true risk landscape of the company. And Avoid any bullet points in your response.", "output": "The top three key risks facing Apple Inc. as detailed in its 2023 Form 10-K are its intense competition and rapid technological change within the industry, its dependence on complex global supply chains and manufacturing relationships, and the evolving regulatory and legal landscape, particularly concerning intellectual property, antitrust, and data privacy issues.\n\nStarting with industry vertical risk, Apple operates within the highly competitive and swiftly evolving technology hardware and software sector. Compared to more stable industries such as utilities or basic consumer staples, this sector presents heightened risks due to rapid product innovation cycles, frequent introduction of new technologies, and aggressive competitors often imitating features or undercutting prices. The industry is heavily affected by intellectual property disputes, with many players seeking to infringe upon or challenge patent rights, making legal and regulatory compliance more complex and uncertain. While industries like pharmaceuticals benefit from more predictable product development and regulatory pathways, technology faces a volatile landscape of innovation, price competition, and evolving standards, which amplifies risk for Apple.\n\nRegarding cyclicality, the technology industry exhibits moderate cyclicality. Apple\u2019s performance is susceptible to broader macroeconomic conditions such as recession, inflation, and currency fluctuations that influence consumer spending and demand for premium devices. During economic slowdowns, consumers tend to postpone or forego discretionary purchases, adversely affecting Apple\u2019s sales, particularly of high-end products. Conversely, in boom periods, demand can resurge but remains sensitive to ongoing technological changes and competitive pressures. The seasonality of sales, especially peaks in the holiday quarter, further compounds this cyclicality, making quarterly results volatile and heavily influenced by macroeconomic cycles. While the industry may not be as cyclical as heavy capital industries, Apple\u2019s revenue still closely tracks economic conditions impacting consumer and enterprise demand.\n\nIn terms of risk quantification, Apple faces significant supply chain and production risks, including shortages of critical components like semiconductors, which in the past have disrupted manufacturing. Its concentration of manufacturing in certain regions such as China, India, and Southeast Asia exposes it to geopolitical risks, trade restrictions, and tariffs, notably amidst U.S.-China tensions. Potential disruptions in these regions, natural disasters, or political conflicts could impair supply continuity. The company also faces legal risks concerning patent claims, with ongoing litigations that could result in costly damages or operational restrictions. Cybersecurity threats, data privacy breaches, and regulatory investigations pose ongoing financial and reputational risks, especially with increasing scrutiny around digital content, App Store practices, and international laws. These risks are supported by recent legal proceedings, investigations, and the volatile regulatory environment, which can have material impacts on cost structures, innovation pace, and market acceptance.\n\nDownside protections for Apple are embedded in its diversified product ecosystem, extensive patent portfolio, and large financial reserves. Its continuous investment in R&D helps sustain technological leadership, potentially keeping competitors at bay. Geographic and product diversification reduce exposure to localized shocks. Strategic supply chain management, long-term supplier agreements, and inventory buffers offer some mitigation against supply disruptions. Legal protections via patents and contractual arrangements act as natural barriers against infringement and imitation. Additionally, Apple\u2019s market position allows it to negotiate long-term supply contracts, and its substantial cash reserves enable it to absorb shocks and invest in risk mitigation initiatives. Nevertheless, the globally interconnected and rapidly changing environment means that these protections are not infallible. Geopolitical conflicts and regulatory shifts, especially those related to antitrust and data privacy, remain persistent challenges and can erode these protections quickly.\n\nIn conclusion, Apple\u2019s risk environment is characterized by a complex interplay of technological innovation, geopolitical and legal uncertainty, and supply chain vulnerabilities. While the company employs strategic protections, the pace of industry change, global political tensions, and cyber threats sustain a high level of residual risk. Success in navigating this landscape depends heavily on Apple\u2019s agility in adapting to evolving legal regulations, maintaining technological differentiation, and managing global supply and geopolitical complexities. Thus, despite its formidable reserves and protections, Apple must continuously evolve its risk management strategies to sustain its market leadership amidst a landscape fraught with significant uncertainties.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nConduct a comprehensive analysis of the company's income statement for the current fiscal year. \nStart with an overall revenue record, including Year-over-Year or Quarter-over-Quarter comparisons, and break down revenue sources to identify primary contributors and trends. \nExamine the Cost of Goods Sold for potential cost control issues. \nReview profit margins such as gross, operating, and net profit margins to evaluate cost efficiency, operational effectiveness, and overall profitability. \nAnalyze Earnings Per Share to understand investor perspectives. \nCompare these metrics with historical data and industry or competitor benchmarks to identify growth patterns, profitability trends, and operational challenges. \nThe output should be a strategic overview of the company\u2019s financial health in a single paragraph, less than 130 words, summarizing the previous analysis into 4-5 key points under respective subheadings with specific discussion and strong data support.", "output": "Revenue Trends: Apple\u2019s 2023 revenue of $383.3 billion marks a 3% decrease YoY, driven mainly by declines in iPhone (-2%) and Mac (-27%) sales, while Services grew 9% to $85.2 billion, indicating a shift toward service-based revenue.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023.

Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nDelve into a detailed scrutiny of the company's balance sheet for the most recent fiscal year, pinpointing the structure of assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity to decode the firm's financial stability and operational efficiency. \nFocus on evaluating the liquidity through current assets versus current liabilities, the solvency via long-term debt ratios, and the equity position to gauge long-term investment potential. \nContrast these metrics with previous years' data to highlight financial trends, improvements, or deteriorations. \nFinalize with a strategic assessment of the company's financial leverage, asset management, and capital structure, providing insights into its fiscal health and future prospects in a single paragraph.

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Japan net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac. \n\nRest of Asia Pacific \n\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased 1% or $240 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significantly unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales. The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nDive into a comprehensive evaluation of the company's cash flow for the latest fiscal year, focusing on cash inflows and outflows across operating, investing, and financing activities. \nExamine the operational cash flow to assess the core business profitability, scrutinize investing activities for insights into capital expenditures and investments, and review financing activities to understand debt, equity movements, and dividend policies. \nCompare these cash movements to prior periods to discern trends, sustainability, and liquidity risks. \nConclude with an informed analysis of the company's cash management effectiveness, liquidity position, and potential for future growth or financial challenges in a single paragraph. Less than 130 words.", "output": "Apple's FY2024 cash flow reflects solid operational profitability with $118.3 billion in operating cash flow, supporting ongoing capital expenditures of $9.45 billion. Despite this, net cash decreased slightly by $794 million mainly due to hefty financing activities, including $94.9 billion spent on stock repurchases and $15.2 billion in dividends. The company generated a modest $2.94 billion from investing activities, primarily from investment sales. Compared to prior years, Apple\u2019s focus on substantial share buybacks and dividends remains prominent, signaling a shareholder-centric strategy but also significant cash outflows. With a substantial cash reserve of nearly $149 billion, Apple maintains strong liquidity, yet its high debt obligations and aggressive capital return programs highlight potential liquidity and leverage risks amid macroeconomic uncertainties. Overall, Apple\u2019s cash management appears effective, though ongoing vigilance is necessary to sustain financial flexibility and growth.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program.

The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nIdentify the company's business segments and create a segment analysis using the Management's Discussion and Analysis and the income statement, subdivided by segment with clear headings. \nAddress revenue and net profit with specific data, and calculate the changes. \nDetail strategic partnerships and their impacts, including details like the companies or organizations. \nDescribe product innovations and their effects on income growth. \nQuantify market share and its changes, or state market position and its changes. \nAnalyze market dynamics and profit challenges, noting any effects from national policy changes. \nInclude the cost side, detailing operational costs, innovation investments, and expenses from channel expansion, etc. \nSupport each statement with evidence, keeping each segment analysis concise and under 60 words, accurately sourcing information. \nFor each segment, consolidate the most significant findings into one clear, concise paragraph, excluding less critical or vaguely described aspects to ensure clarity and reliance on evidence-backed information.

Long-term debt remains manageable at $85.8 billion, supporting a stable debt-to-equity ratio despite a slight decrease in shareholders' equity to $56.95 billion from $62.1 billion in 2022. Asset efficiency is demonstrated through high investments ($126.7 billion), yet liquidity pressures signal the need for prudent cash flow management. Overall, the firm maintains strong financial resilience driven by large asset holdings and consistent capital deployment, although elevated liabilities and currency risks present challenges that require strategic oversight to preserve long-term stability and growth potential.\n\n\n-- analyze_cash_flow --\nApple's FY 2023 robust operating cash flow of $118.25 billion underscores strong business profitability. The modest $2.94 billion inflow from investing activities, mainly from investment sales offsetting capital spending of $9.45 billion, indicates ongoing reinvestment in growth. However, substantial $122 billion outflow in financing activities, chiefly from net stock repurchases ($94.9 billion) and dividends ($15.2 billion), highlights aggressive capital return strategies. Despite these outflows, Apple maintains a healthy liquidity position with nearly $29.9 billion in cash at period end, balancing liquidity and shareholder returns. This effective cash management supports financial stability but suggests future flexibility could be challenged by continued large-scale buybacks and dividend commitments amid macroeconomic headwinds.\n", "output": "Apple Inc.\u2019s FY2024 financials reflect solid performance with revenues increasing to $391 billion, despite a slight 3% decline year-over-year primarily due to currency impacts and weaker Mac and iPhone sales.

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. \n\nCloud Services \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cloud services store and keep customers&#8217; content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. \n\nDigital Content \n\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store &#174; , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. \n\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade &#174; , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music &#174; , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ &#174; , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ &#174; , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. \n\nPayment Services \n\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card &#174; , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay &#174; , a cashless payment service. \n\nSegments \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company&#8217;s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company&#8217;s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. \n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company&#8217;s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. \n\nSupply of Components \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. \n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. \n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. \n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company&#8217;s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 \n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. \n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies \n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company&#8217;s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees&#8217; individual growth and development. \n\nInclusion and Diversity \n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. \n\nEngagement \n\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year.

The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction:\nAccording to the given information above, describe the performance highlights for each company's business line.

The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product. \n\nCloud Services \n\nThe Company&#8217;s cloud services store and keep customers&#8217; content up-to-date and available across multiple Apple devices and Windows personal computers. \n\nDigital Content \n\nThe Company operates various platforms, including the App Store &#174; , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts. \n\nThe Company also offers digital content through subscription-based services, including Apple Arcade &#174; , a game subscription service; Apple Fitness+ SM , a personalized fitness service; Apple Music &#174; , which offers users a curated listening experience with on-demand radio stations; Apple News+ &#174; , a subscription news and magazine service; and Apple TV+ &#174; , which offers exclusive original content and live sports. \n\nPayment Services \n\nThe Company offers payment services, including Apple Card &#174; , a co-branded credit card, and Apple Pay &#174; , a cashless payment service. \n\nSegments \n\nThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company&#8217;s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company&#8217;s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company&#8217;s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. \n\nMarkets and Distribution \n\nThe Company&#8217;s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company&#8217;s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. \n\nCompetition \n\nThe markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. \n\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company&#8217;s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. \n\nSupply of Components \n\nAlthough most components essential to the Company&#8217;s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. \n\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. \n\nThe Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. \n\nResearch and Development \n\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. \n\nIntellectual Property \n\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. \n\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. \n\nIn addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company&#8217;s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 \n\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company&#8217;s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. \n\nHuman Capital \n\nThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. \n\nWorkplace Practices and Policies \n\nThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. \n\nCompensation and Benefits \n\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company&#8217;s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees&#8217; individual growth and development. \n\nInclusion and Diversity \n\nThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. \n\nEngagement \n\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. \n\nHealth and Safety \n\nThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team. \n\nAvailable Information \n\nThe Company&#8217;s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Europe net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories, partially offset by higher net sales of iPhone and Services. \n\nGreater China \n\nGreater China net sales decreased 2% or $1.6 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Greater China net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone. \n\nJapan \n\nJapan net sales decreased 7% or $1.7 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in Japan net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Mac. \n\nRest of Asia Pacific \n\nRest of Asia Pacific net sales increased 1% or $240 million during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had a significantly unfavorable year-over-year impact on Rest of Asia Pacific net sales. The net sales increase consisted of higher net sales of iPhone and Services, partially offset by lower net sales of Mac and iPad. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 21 \n\nProducts and Services Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by category for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by category: iPhone (1) \n\n$ 200,583 (2) % $ 205,489 7 % $ 191,973 Mac (1) \n\n29,357 (27) % 40,177 14 % 35,190 iPad (1) \n\n28,300 (3) % 29,292 (8) % 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories (1) \n\n39,845 (3) % 41,241 7 % 38,367 Services (2) \n\n85,200 9 % 78,129 14 % 68,425 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\n(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product. \n\n(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. \n\niPhone \n\niPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models. \n\nMac \n\nMac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops. \n\niPad \n\niPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation. \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories \n\nWearables, Home and Accessories net sales decreased 3% or $1.4 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of Wearables and Accessories. \n\nServices \n\nServices net sales increased 9% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher net sales across all lines of business. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 22 \n\nGross Margin \n\nProducts and Services gross margin and gross margin percentage for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Gross margin: Products $ 108,803 $ 114,728 $ 105,126 Services 60,345 56,054 47,710 Total gross margin $ 169,148 $ 170,782 $ 152,836 ##TABLE_END\n\n##TABLE_START Gross margin percentage: Products 36.5 % 36.3 % 35.3 % Services 70.8 % 71.7 % 69.7 % Total gross margin percentage 44.1 % 43.3 % 41.8 % ##TABLE_END\n\nProducts Gross Margin \n\nProducts gross margin decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower Products volume, partially offset by cost savings and a different Products mix. \n\nProducts gross margin percentage increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and decreased leverage. \n\nServices Gross Margin \n\nServices gross margin increased during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to higher Services net sales, partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and higher Services costs. \n\nServices gross margin percentage decreased during 2023 compared to 2022 due to higher Services costs and the weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by a different Services mix. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nThe Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. \n\nLeases \n\nThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nManufacturing Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company&#8217;s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company&#8217;s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. \n\nOther Purchase Obligations \n\nThe Company&#8217;s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. \n\nDeemed Repatriation Tax Payable \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 \n\nCapital Return Program \n\nIn addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. \n\nCritical Accounting Estimates \n\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and the Company&#8217;s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company&#8217;s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nAccording to the given information, \n1.

Risk Factors \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. \n\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. \n\nThis section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; of this Form 10-K. \n\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales. In addition, the Company&#8217;s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company&#8217;s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. \n\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors. \n\nIn addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency. \n\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company&#8217;s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company&#8217;s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company&#8217;s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. \n\nPolitical events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5 \n\nThe Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company&#8217;s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operations and supply chain and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company&#8217;s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company&#8217;s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nMany of the Company&#8217;s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company&#8217;s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company&#8217;s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company&#8217;s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company&#8217;s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company&#8217;s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company&#8217;s business, and harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company&#8217;s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. \n\nGlobal markets for the Company&#8217;s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&#38;D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6 \n\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company&#8217;s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company&#8217;s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company&#8217;s intellectual property, the Company&#8217;s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected. \n\nThe Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. \n\nAdditionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company&#8217;s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company&#8217;s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. \n\nBusiness Risks \n\nTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. \n\nDue to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company&#8217;s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company&#8217;s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services. \n\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. \n\nSubstantially all of the Company&#8217;s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company&#8217;s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company&#8217;s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company&#8217;s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7 \n\nThe Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company&#8217;s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company&#8217;s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. \n\nThe Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. \n\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. \n\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company&#8217;s suppliers, described in &#8220; The Company&#8217;s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, &#8221; above, can also affect the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers&#8217; yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company&#8217;s requirements. When the Company&#8217;s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company&#8217;s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation. \n\nThe Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company&#8217;s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company&#8217;s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company&#8217;s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company&#8217;s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company&#8217;s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8 \n\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. \n\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers&#8217; facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. \n\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company&#8217;s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company&#8217;s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. \n\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company&#8217;s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. \n\nThe Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company&#8217;s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company&#8217;s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nThe Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers&#8217; perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company&#8217;s products compared to competitors&#8217; platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company&#8217;s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors&#8217; products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company&#8217;s devices can suffer. \n\nThe Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company&#8217;s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9 \n\nThe Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nFailure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company&#8217;s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company&#8217;s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company&#8217;s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules. \n\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company&#8217;s customers. \n\nSome third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company&#8217;s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture. \n\nMuch of the Company&#8217;s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company&#8217;s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s culture, reputation and operational flexibility. \n\nThe Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. \n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. \n\nSome carriers providing cellular network service for the Company&#8217;s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users&#8217; purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10 \n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers&#8217; stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company&#8217;s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company&#8217;s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company&#8217;s products. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. \n\nThe Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company&#8217;s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company&#8217;s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nLosses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company&#8217;s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company&#8217;s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company&#8217;s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company&#8217;s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company&#8217;s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict. \n\nAlthough malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. \n\nThe Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company&#8217;s or its vendors&#8217; systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company&#8217;s products and services. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11 \n\nInvestment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company&#8217;s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company&#8217;s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company&#8217;s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. \n\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. \n\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. \n\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. \n\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company&#8217;s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company&#8217;s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer certain products and services. \n\nExcept as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, &#8220;Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations&#8221; under the heading &#8220;Contingencies,&#8221; in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. \n\nThe outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management&#8217;s expectations, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12 \n\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti&#8211;money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change. \n\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business by increasing the Company&#8217;s costs, limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company&#8217;s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company&#8217;s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company&#8217;s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company&#8217;s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company&#8217;s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company&#8217;s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s business. \n\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company&#8217;s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company&#8217;s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. \n\nThe technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. \n\nFrom time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13 \n\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. \n\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company&#8217;s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. \n\nThere can be no assurance the Company&#8217;s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company&#8217;s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company&#8217;s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company&#8217;s products and services, and result in harm to the Company&#8217;s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. \n\nThe Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. \n\nThe Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. \n\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company&#8217;s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company&#8217;s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines. \n\nPayment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14 \n\nFinancial Risks \n\nThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company&#8217;s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company&#8217;s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company&#8217;s services; the Company&#8217;s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company&#8217;s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company&#8217;s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non&#8211;U.S. dollar&#8211;denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company&#8217;s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. \n\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company&#8217;s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar&#8217;s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales. \n\nConversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company&#8217;s foreign currency&#8211;denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company&#8217;s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. \n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company&#8217;s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15 \n\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. \n\nThe Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company&#8217;s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company&#8217;s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company&#8217;s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company&#8217;s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. \n\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. \n\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company&#8217;s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations. \n\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company&#8217;s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company&#8217;s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. \n\nGeneral Risks \n\nThe price of the Company&#8217;s stock is subject to volatility. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies&#8217; operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock&#8217;s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors, and the Company&#8217;s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company&#8217;s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nAccording to the given information in the 10-k report, summarize the top 3 key risks of the company. \nThen, for each key risk, break down the risk assessment into the following aspects:\n1. Industry Vertical Risk: How does this industry vertical compare with others in terms of risk? Consider factors such as regulation, market volatility, and competitive landscape.\n2. Cyclicality: How cyclical is this industry? Discuss the impact of economic cycles on the company\u2019s performance.\n3. Risk Quantification: Enumerate the key risk factors with supporting data if the company or segment is deemed risky.\n4. Downside Protections: If the company or segment is less risky, discuss the downside protections in place. Consider factors such as diversification, long-term contracts, and government regulation.\nFinally, provide a detailed and nuanced assessment that reflects the true risk landscape of the company. And Avoid any bullet points in your response.", "output": "The three most significant risks confronting Apple Inc. as outlined in its 10-K report include the risks arising from global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, the intense competition and rapid technological innovation within the technology industry, and the complex evolving legal and regulatory environment, especially regarding antitrust, intellectual property, and data privacy laws.\n\nRegarding the first risk, Apple\u2019s operations are heavily dependent on the global economy, making it highly susceptible to macroeconomic and political fluctuations. Compared to more stable industries or regional-focused businesses, the tech sector\u2019s vertical is particularly sensitive to currency fluctuations, trade restrictions, and regional economic downturns. The company\u2019s significant reliance on international markets and supply chains\u2014primarily in Asia\u2014means that economic slowdowns, tariffs, or political conflicts like US-China tensions could severely disrupt sales and manufacturing. The risk quantification here involves potential supply chain interruptions, increased costs, or reduced consumer demand in key markets, especially given the concentration of manufacturing in earthquake-prone areas or regions exposed to natural disasters. Apple mitigates these risks through supplier diversification and currency hedging, but complete protection remains elusive due to the uncontrollable nature of geopolitical and environmental factors.\n\nThe second major risk stems from the highly competitive and fast-changing nature of the technology industry. Apple operates in markets with aggressive price competition, rapid product obsolescence, and frequent innovation cycles, making this vertical particularly volatile. Unlike industries with longer product cycles or slower innovation, the tech sector experiences continual disruption driven by new technologies, standards, and competitors copying or surpassing Apple\u2019s features. Market share remains modest in key segments (smartphones, PCs), heightening exposure to competitive strategies such as price cuts or innovation gaps. The primary risk factors include declining margins due to competitive pricing, the risk of falling behind in technological advancements, and patent infringements. Apple\u2019s defenses include its integrated ecosystem, substantial R&D investments, and intellectual property protections, but given the pace of innovation, these protections offer limited insulation from the risk of rapid obsolescence.\n\nThe third prominent risk involves the ongoing legal and regulatory challenges, notably antitrust investigations, intellectual property disputes, and privacy laws, which vary internationally and are continually evolving. Compared to more stable industry environments, the tech sector faces frequent regulatory scrutiny regarding market dominance, data protection, and app distribution policies. These legal risks are cyclical, often intensifying in response to technological or market developments, and can result in significant penalties, business restrictions, or mandates to alter business practices. Quantitative aspects include the possibility of hefty fines or mandated changes that could diminish revenue from services or necessitate costly operational modifications. Apple\u2019s protections involve compliance programs, engagement with regulators, and geographical diversification, but the unpredictable and politically charged nature of the legal landscape means vulnerabilities remain.\n\nIn sum, Apple\u2019s risk landscape is layered and interconnected, characterized by external macroeconomic and geopolitical vulnerabilities, rapid technological change leading to fierce industry competition, and a complex regulatory environment that can swiftly impact business practices. Its sizable financial resources, strategic diversification, and innovation efforts provide some protections, but many risks\u2014particularly those driven by geopolitics and regulation\u2014are beyond direct control. To navigate this landscape successfully, Apple must continuously adapt its supply chains, innovate ahead of competitors, and engage proactively with regulators, understanding that some risks can only be mitigated rather than fully eliminated. Recognizing this nuanced risk profile underscores the importance of agility, diversification, and vigilant risk management for sustained long-term success.", "tool": "summarize"}}

The section MUST be between 500 and 600 words. Synthesize and clarify\u2014avoid repeating content and do not copy sentences verbatim.\n\nSections:\n-- get_risk_assessment --\nThe top three key risks facing Apple Inc. as detailed in its 2023 Form 10-K are its intense competition and rapid technological change within the industry, its dependence on complex global supply chains and manufacturing relationships, and the evolving regulatory and legal landscape, particularly concerning intellectual property, antitrust, and data privacy issues.\n\nStarting with industry vertical risk, Apple operates within the highly competitive and swiftly evolving technology hardware and software sector. Compared to more stable industries such as utilities or basic consumer staples, this sector presents heightened risks due to rapid product innovation cycles, frequent introduction of new technologies, and aggressive competitors often imitating features or undercutting prices. The industry is heavily affected by intellectual property disputes, with many players seeking to infringe upon or challenge patent rights, making legal and regulatory compliance more complex and uncertain. While industries like pharmaceuticals benefit from more predictable product development and regulatory pathways, technology faces a volatile landscape of innovation, price competition, and evolving standards, which amplifies risk for Apple.\n\nRegarding cyclicality, the technology industry exhibits moderate cyclicality. Apple\u2019s performance is susceptible to broader macroeconomic conditions such as recession, inflation, and currency fluctuations that influence consumer spending and demand for premium devices. During economic slowdowns, consumers tend to postpone or forego discretionary purchases, adversely affecting Apple\u2019s sales, particularly of high-end products. Conversely, in boom periods, demand can resurge but remains sensitive to ongoing technological changes and competitive pressures. The seasonality of sales, especially peaks in the holiday quarter, further compounds this cyclicality, making quarterly results volatile and heavily influenced by macroeconomic cycles. While the industry may not be as cyclical as heavy capital industries, Apple\u2019s revenue still closely tracks economic conditions impacting consumer and enterprise demand.\n\nIn terms of risk quantification, Apple faces significant supply chain and production risks, including shortages of critical components like semiconductors, which in the past have disrupted manufacturing. Its concentration of manufacturing in certain regions such as China, India, and Southeast Asia exposes it to geopolitical risks, trade restrictions, and tariffs, notably amidst U.S.-China tensions. Potential disruptions in these regions, natural disasters, or political conflicts could impair supply continuity. The company also faces legal risks concerning patent claims, with ongoing litigations that could result in costly damages or operational restrictions. Cybersecurity threats, data privacy breaches, and regulatory investigations pose ongoing financial and reputational risks, especially with increasing scrutiny around digital content, App Store practices, and international laws. These risks are supported by recent legal proceedings, investigations, and the volatile regulatory environment, which can have material impacts on cost structures, innovation pace, and market acceptance.\n\nDownside protections for Apple are embedded in its diversified product ecosystem, extensive patent portfolio, and large financial reserves. Its continuous investment in R&D helps sustain technological leadership, potentially keeping competitors at bay. Geographic and product diversification reduce exposure to localized shocks. Strategic supply chain management, long-term supplier agreements, and inventory buffers offer some mitigation against supply disruptions. Legal protections via patents and contractual arrangements act as natural barriers against infringement and imitation. Additionally, Apple\u2019s market position allows it to negotiate long-term supply contracts, and its substantial cash reserves enable it to absorb shocks and invest in risk mitigation initiatives. Nevertheless, the globally interconnected and rapidly changing environment means that these protections are not infallible. Geopolitical conflicts and regulatory shifts, especially those related to antitrust and data privacy, remain persistent challenges and can erode these protections quickly.\n\nIn conclusion, Apple\u2019s risk environment is characterized by a complex interplay of technological innovation, geopolitical and legal uncertainty, and supply chain vulnerabilities. While the company employs strategic protections, the pace of industry change, global political tensions, and cyber threats sustain a high level of residual risk. Success in navigating this landscape depends heavily on Apple\u2019s agility in adapting to evolving legal regulations, maintaining technological differentiation, and managing global supply and geopolitical complexities. Thus, despite its formidable reserves and protections, Apple must continuously evolve its risk management strategies to sustain its market leadership amidst a landscape fraught with significant uncertainties.\n", "output": "Risk Assessment\n\nApple Inc. operates within the highly dynamic and fiercely competitive technology hardware and software sector, characterized by rapid innovation cycles and frequent introduction of new technologies. Unlike more stable industries, this environment compels Apple to continuously invest in research and development to maintain its technological leadership and market position. Intense competition from aggressive rivals who often replicate features or compete on price, coupled with an industry landscape marked by frequent intellectual property disputes, significantly elevates the company\u2019s operational risks. Furthermore, evolving regulatory scrutiny\u2014particularly in areas of antitrust, data privacy, and digital content management\u2014adds complexity and uncertainty to the company\u2019s compliance obligations.\n\nThe company\u2019s performance is also influenced by the moderate cyclicality of the technology sector, which is sensitive to broad macroeconomic factors such as recessions, inflation, and currency fluctuations. Consumer demand for Apple\u2019s premium products tends to contract during economic downturns as discretionary spending is curtailed, adversely affecting sales volumes. Conversely, during economic upswings, demand can rebound, although sustained growth is challenged by constant technological advancements and competitive pressures. Seasonal variations, especially the strong holiday quarter sales, further introduce quarterly earnings volatility, underscoring the dependence on consumer behavior and prevailing economic conditions.\n\nA pivotal risk factor for Apple stems from its complex, globally dispersed supply chain and manufacturing operations concentrated primarily in China, India, and Southeast Asia. This geographic concentration exposes the company to geopolitical tensions\u2014most notably the ongoing U.S.-China trade frictions\u2014that may result in tariffs, trade restrictions, or other disruptions. Supply chain vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the risk of shortages in critical components such as semiconductors, which have historically triggered production delays. Additionally, natural disasters or political unrest in these regions could interrupt supply continuity, highlighting a critical exposure area for the company\u2019s operational resilience.\n\nLegal and regulatory risks also constitute a significant portion of Apple\u2019s risk landscape. The company\u2019s broad patent portfolio serves as both a defensive asset and a source of potential litigation, with ongoing patent claims posing threats of costly settlements or operational injunctions. Heightened global regulatory scrutiny includes investigations into antitrust compliance, App Store practices, and data privacy adherence, which could lead to material penalties and constrain business operations. Cybersecurity threats and the risk of data breaches further complicate this environment, risking financial loss, regulatory sanctions, and damage to Apple\u2019s reputation.\n\nTo counterbalance these risks, Apple leverages a diversified product ecosystem and significant investments in innovation, underpinned by an extensive intellectual property portfolio, which collectively help maintain competitive advantage. Geographic and product diversification mitigate localized risks, while strategic supply chain initiatives\u2014such as long-term agreements with suppliers and inventory buffers\u2014aim to alleviate potential disruptions. Apple\u2019s substantial financial resources provide a strong foundation to absorb shocks, fund risk management efforts, and sustain R&D initiatives. Moreover, legal protections through patents and contracts offer natural barriers against infringement and imitation.\n\nNevertheless, these protective measures are not impervious. The swiftly evolving technology sector, persistent geopolitical tensions, and increasingly stringent regulatory demands require continuous adaptability. Apple must remain agile in responding to shifting legal landscapes, sustaining technological differentiation, and managing the complexities of a global supply chain vulnerable to external shocks.\n\nIn summary, Apple\u2019s risk environment is defined by the interplay of fast-paced technological innovation, geopolitical uncertainties, supply chain dependencies, and rigorous legal and regulatory challenges.

Discuss how its performance over these years and across these metrics might justify or contradict its current market valuation (as reflected in the EV/EBITDA ratio).\nAvoid using any bullet points.", "output": "Based on the provided financial metrics, it is evident that the company with a market capitalization of approximately $3 trillion USD and a book value per share of $3.71 is currently facing limited transparency regarding its recent operational performance. The absence of explicit figures for EBITDA margin, EBITDA, free cash flow (FCF) conversion, revenue, and revenue growth over multiple years makes it challenging to identify clear trends or assess the company's trajectory. Without year-over-year data, we cannot determine whether these key profitability and efficiency metrics are improving, stable, or declining.\n\nIf we consider typical company performance patterns, consistent improvements in EBITDA margin, revenue growth, and FCF conversion would indicate a healthy, efficiently managed business, often justifying a high valuation. Conversely, declining margins, stagnating revenues, or deteriorating cash flow metrics would raise concerns about sustainability and could justify skepticism towards the current market cap. Since such data is missing, a definitive trend analysis is not feasible.\n\nIn a competitive context, comparing this firm to its peers would typically involve examining how its EBITDA margins and EV/EBITDA ratios stack against industry averages. For example, a high EV/EBITDA ratio relative to competitors could suggest overvaluation unless supported by superior growth prospects or strategic advantages. Conversely, a lower valuation might imply market doubts about its profitability or growth potential. Without concrete competitor figures, however, such comparisons remain speculative.\n\nFocusing on valuation metrics, the EV/EBITDA ratio provides insights into how the market values the company's earnings relative to its enterprise value. Given the market cap magnitude but the lack of recent earnings data, it is difficult to determine whether the company is overvalued or undervalued. A high EV/EBITDA might indicate expectations of future growth, but it could also suggest overpricing if profitability and cash flows are declining or stagnant, which seems probable given the limited data.\n\nRegarding profitability and efficiency insights, the missing EBITDA margins and FCF conversion data hinder precise assessment. Should recent margins be low or shrinking relative to historical levels, it would point to decreasing profitability, whereas stable or improving margins would support the current valuation. Similarly, the absence of income and cash flow trends prevents detailed analysis of return on invested capital (ROIC), though high ROIC typically signals effective use of capital and supports higher valuations.\n\nRevenue and revenue growth are crucial for understanding the company's market position and future potential. Without recent figures, any judgment on growth trends is speculative. Historically, companies with consistent revenue growth tend to command premium valuations, especially if growth accelerates; stagnation or decline could undermine investor confidence.\n\nIn conclusion, the overall financial health of this entity appears uncertain based on the limited data available. The enormous market cap suggests positive market sentiment, likely driven by expectations of future growth, strategic positioning, or market perception. However, the lack of recent detailed financial performance metrics hampers a thorough evaluation. If the company\u2019s core profitability, cash flow efficiency, and revenue growth are weak or declining, the current valuation and EV/EBITDA multiple could be seen as overoptimistic or inflated, contradicting fundamentals. Conversely, if underlying metrics are healthy and trending favorably, the valuation might be justified. Ultimately, comprehensive, transparent financial disclosure remains critical for meaningful assessment and accurate valuation justification.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Opportunities for growth include new product categories like AR/VR, health tech, and expanding services footprint.\n\nRecently, Apple launched new products including the iPhone 15 lineup, updated MacBook Pro and Mac Studio models, and the spatial computing device Apple Vision Pro. The company also announced a $90 billion share repurchase program and continues to focus on product innovation, market expansion, and bolstering its services ecosystem. These initiatives reflect its strategic response to dynamic market conditions and technological shifts.\n\n\n-- analyze_business_highlights --\nCertainly! Here's a concise summary of each Apple's business line performance:\n\n**iPhone:**  \n*Summary:* The iPhone experienced a slight decline in sales due to weaker demand for non-Pro models.  \n*Explanation:* A 2% decrease in overall sales was partly offset by increased Pro model sales, indicating sustained demand for premium smartphones.\n\n**Mac:**  \n*Summary:* Mac sales dropped sharply by 27%, mainly from lower laptop sales.  \n*Explanation:* Reduced demand across MacBook and desktop lines contributed to the decline, reflecting market fluctuations and product lifecycle effects.\n\n**iPad:**  \n*Summary:* iPad sales saw a modest decrease of 3%, showing stable but subdued demand.  \n*Explanation:* Lower sales of iPad mini and Air were somewhat balanced by recent model sales, indicating steady but cautious consumer interest.\n\n**Wearables, Home, and Accessories:**  \n*Summary:* This segment's sales decreased slightly by 3%.  \n*Explanation:* Lower sales of wearables and accessories, like AirPods and Apple Watch, contributed, though the overall category remains popular.\n\n**Services:**  \n*Summary:* The Services segment grew by 9%, driven by increased subscriptions and content sales.  \n*Explanation:* Higher revenue in Apple Music, News+, and Apple TV+ offset currency pressure, demonstrating strong service adoption.\n\n\n-- analyze_income_stmt --\nRevenue and Trends  \nApple's revenue reached $391 billion in FY2024, a slight increase from $383 billion in FY2023, with a minor decline of 3% YoY primarily attributable to foreign currency effects and lower Mac and iPhone sales.  \nProfitability Margins  \nGross margin slightly improved to 44.1% from 43.3%, driven by cost reductions and product mix shifts, while net income remained strong at $93.7 billion, reflecting operational efficiency.  \nCost Control and Expenses  \nOperating expenses rose marginally to $54.8 billion, with R&D expenses up 14% to $29.9 billion, indicating continued focus on innovation, and cost management helped sustain margin expansion despite revenue pressures.  \nEPS and Investor Outlook  \nEarnings per share stood at $6.11, slightly below $6.16 in 2023, supported by substantial share repurchases of $76.6 billion, reinforcing investor confidence in Apple\u2019s steady growth and capital return strategy.  \nOverall, Apple exhibits solid financial health with resilient margins, disciplined cost control, and strategic innovation investments, maintaining leadership amid global economic uncertainties.\n\n\n-- analyze_balance_sheet --\nApple's latest balance sheet indicates a solid asset base totaling $365 billion, with substantial liquidity as current assets ($153 billion) slightly lag current liabilities ($176 billion), mainly due to significant short-term debt ($20.9 billion). Long-term debt remains manageable at $85.8 billion, supporting a stable debt-to-equity ratio despite a slight decrease in shareholders' equity to $56.95 billion from $62.1 billion in 2022. Asset efficiency is demonstrated through high investments ($126.7 billion), yet liquidity pressures signal the need for prudent cash flow management. Overall, the firm maintains strong financial resilience driven by large asset holdings and consistent capital deployment, although elevated liabilities and currency risks present challenges that require strategic oversight to preserve long-term stability and growth potential.\n\n\n-- analyze_cash_flow --\nApple's FY 2023 robust operating cash flow of $118.25 billion underscores strong business profitability. The modest $2.94 billion inflow from investing activities, mainly from investment sales offsetting capital spending of $9.45 billion, indicates ongoing reinvestment in growth. However, substantial $122 billion outflow in financing activities, chiefly from net stock repurchases ($94.9 billion) and dividends ($15.2 billion), highlights aggressive capital return strategies. Despite these outflows, Apple maintains a healthy liquidity position with nearly $29.9 billion in cash at period end, balancing liquidity and shareholder returns. This effective cash management supports financial stability but suggests future flexibility could be challenged by continued large-scale buybacks and dividend commitments amid macroeconomic headwinds.\n\n\n-- get_risk_assessment --\nThe top three key risks facing Apple Inc. as detailed in its 2023 Form 10-K are its intense competition and rapid technological change within the industry, its dependence on complex global supply chains and manufacturing relationships, and the evolving regulatory and legal landscape, particularly concerning intellectual property, antitrust, and data privacy issues.\n\nStarting with industry vertical risk, Apple operates within the highly competitive and swiftly evolving technology hardware and software sector. Compared to more stable industries such as utilities or basic consumer staples, this sector presents heightened risks due to rapid product innovation cycles, frequent introduction of new technologies, and aggressive competitors often imitating features or undercutting prices. The industry is heavily affected by intellectual property disputes, with many players seeking to infringe upon or challenge patent rights, making legal and regulatory compliance more complex and uncertain. While industries like pharmaceuticals benefit from more predictable product development and regulatory pathways, technology faces a volatile landscape of innovation, price competition, and evolving standards, which amplifies risk for Apple.\n\nRegarding cyclicality, the technology industry exhibits moderate cyclicality. Apple\u2019s performance is susceptible to broader macroeconomic conditions such as recession, inflation, and currency fluctuations that influence consumer spending and demand for premium devices. During economic slowdowns, consumers tend to postpone or forego discretionary purchases, adversely affecting Apple\u2019s sales, particularly of high-end products. Conversely, in boom periods, demand can resurge but remains sensitive to ongoing technological changes and competitive pressures. The seasonality of sales, especially peaks in the holiday quarter, further compounds this cyclicality, making quarterly results volatile and heavily influenced by macroeconomic cycles. While the industry may not be as cyclical as heavy capital industries, Apple\u2019s revenue still closely tracks economic conditions impacting consumer and enterprise demand.\n\nIn terms of risk quantification, Apple faces significant supply chain and production risks, including shortages of critical components like semiconductors, which in the past have disrupted manufacturing. Its concentration of manufacturing in certain regions such as China, India, and Southeast Asia exposes it to geopolitical risks, trade restrictions, and tariffs, notably amidst U.S.-China tensions. Potential disruptions in these regions, natural disasters, or political conflicts could impair supply continuity. The company also faces legal risks concerning patent claims, with ongoing litigations that could result in costly damages or operational restrictions. Cybersecurity threats, data privacy breaches, and regulatory investigations pose ongoing financial and reputational risks, especially with increasing scrutiny around digital content, App Store practices, and international laws. These risks are supported by recent legal proceedings, investigations, and the volatile regulatory environment, which can have material impacts on cost structures, innovation pace, and market acceptance.\n\nDownside protections for Apple are embedded in its diversified product ecosystem, extensive patent portfolio, and large financial reserves. Its continuous investment in R&D helps sustain technological leadership, potentially keeping competitors at bay. Geographic and product diversification reduce exposure to localized shocks. Strategic supply chain management, long-term supplier agreements, and inventory buffers offer some mitigation against supply disruptions. Legal protections via patents and contractual arrangements act as natural barriers against infringement and imitation. Additionally, Apple\u2019s market position allows it to negotiate long-term supply contracts, and its substantial cash reserves enable it to absorb shocks and invest in risk mitigation initiatives. Nevertheless, the globally interconnected and rapidly changing environment means that these protections are not infallible. Geopolitical conflicts and regulatory shifts, especially those related to antitrust and data privacy, remain persistent challenges and can erode these protections quickly.\n\nIn conclusion, Apple\u2019s risk environment is characterized by a complex interplay of technological innovation, geopolitical and legal uncertainty, and supply chain vulnerabilities. While the company employs strategic protections, the pace of industry change, global political tensions, and cyber threats sustain a high level of residual risk. Success in navigating this landscape depends heavily on Apple\u2019s agility in adapting to evolving legal regulations, maintaining technological differentiation, and managing global supply and geopolitical complexities. Thus, despite its formidable reserves and protections, Apple must continuously evolve its risk management strategies to sustain its market leadership amidst a landscape fraught with significant uncertainties.\n\n\n-- get_competitors_analysis --\nYour message appears to be empty.

Apple\u2019s geographical reach spans key regions including North America, Europe, Greater China, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with North America contributing the largest revenue share.\n\nIn fiscal 2024, Apple reported revenue of $391 billion, reflecting a slight gain over the previous year\u2019s $383 billion despite challenges including adverse foreign currency effects and subdued demand in several flagship product lines. iPhone sales slid by 2%, primarily due to diminished demand for non-Pro models, although resilience in Pro segment sales partially offset this weakness. More significantly, Mac revenues declined sharply by 27%, driven by softer demand for laptops and desktops amid market fluctuations. The iPad segment remained relatively stable with a 3% revenue dip, while wearables, home, and accessories experienced a modest 3% sales decline. These headwinds were counterbalanced by a strong 9% growth in Services revenue, fueled by rising subscriptions and content consumption in platforms such as Apple Music, Apple TV+, and News+, illustrating Apple\u2019s strategic pivot toward recurring revenue streams.\n\nFinancially, Apple maintains robust profitability and operational efficiency. Gross margin expanded slightly to 44.1% from 43.3%, benefiting from a favorable product mix and effective cost controls. Net income stood at an impressive $93.7 billion, showcasing the company\u2019s ability to sustain earnings despite revenue pressures. Operating expenses saw a measured increase to $54.8 billion, including a notable 14% jump in research and development investment to approximately $29.9 billion. This heightened R&D commitment underscores Apple\u2019s focus on innovation as a key engine of long-term growth amid persistent macroeconomic uncertainties. The company\u2019s balance sheet remains strong with total assets of $365 billion, supported by substantial investments and liquidity. However, current liabilities slightly exceed current assets due partly to short-term debt obligations, signaling the need for ongoing cash flow discipline. Apple\u2019s cash position near $29.9 billion and strong operating cash flow over $118 billion complement its aggressive capital return policy, reflected in $94.9 billion in share repurchases and $15.2 billion in dividends during the period.\n\nStrategically, Apple continues to invest in new product categories aligned with macro industry trends such as 5G adoption, augmented reality, and AI. Recent launches\u2014including the iPhone 15 series, updated MacBook Pro and Mac Studio, and the groundbreaking Apple Vision Pro spatial computing device\u2014demonstrate its ambition to lead in emerging technologies and expand its ecosystem. The announcement of a $90 billion stock repurchase program further signals confidence in the company\u2019s growth trajectory and cash generation capacity.\n\nNonetheless, Apple faces pronounced risks inherent in the fast-evolving tech sector. These include intense competition marked by rapid innovation cycles and pricing pressure, supply chain vulnerabilities due to concentrated manufacturing in politically sensitive regions such as China, and a complex, evolving regulatory environment challenged by antitrust scrutiny, intellectual property disputes, and data privacy concerns. Economic cyclicalities and currency fluctuations further add volatility to demand for Apple\u2019s premium-priced offerings. The company\u2019s risk mitigation is grounded in geographical and product diversification, expansive patent holdings, and significant financial reserves, but these safeguards are not impervious to geopolitical tensions and swift regulatory changes.\n\nIn sum, Apple\u2019s leadership is underpinned by its innovation prowess, a diversified and growing services business, and a resilient financial position characterized by strong margins and disciplined capital deployment. While the near-term softness in Mac and iPhone sales and geopolitical complexities pose challenges, the company\u2019s ability to continuously evolve its product portfolio and ecosystem, coupled with aggressive capital returns, supports a compelling investment narrative. Apple is well-positioned to capitalize on technological shifts and emerging markets while managing risks inherent in a volatile global environment, offering investors a blend of stability and growth potential in the dynamic technology industry.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Compared to more stable industries or regional-focused businesses, the tech sector\u2019s vertical is particularly sensitive to currency fluctuations, trade restrictions, and regional economic downturns. The company\u2019s significant reliance on international markets and supply chains\u2014primarily in Asia\u2014means that economic slowdowns, tariffs, or political conflicts like US-China tensions could severely disrupt sales and manufacturing. The risk quantification here involves potential supply chain interruptions, increased costs, or reduced consumer demand in key markets, especially given the concentration of manufacturing in earthquake-prone areas or regions exposed to natural disasters. Apple mitigates these risks through supplier diversification and currency hedging, but complete protection remains elusive due to the uncontrollable nature of geopolitical and environmental factors.\n\nThe second major risk stems from the highly competitive and fast-changing nature of the technology industry. Apple operates in markets with aggressive price competition, rapid product obsolescence, and frequent innovation cycles, making this vertical particularly volatile. Unlike industries with longer product cycles or slower innovation, the tech sector experiences continual disruption driven by new technologies, standards, and competitors copying or surpassing Apple\u2019s features. Market share remains modest in key segments (smartphones, PCs), heightening exposure to competitive strategies such as price cuts or innovation gaps. The primary risk factors include declining margins due to competitive pricing, the risk of falling behind in technological advancements, and patent infringements. Apple\u2019s defenses include its integrated ecosystem, substantial R&D investments, and intellectual property protections, but given the pace of innovation, these protections offer limited insulation from the risk of rapid obsolescence.\n\nThe third prominent risk involves the ongoing legal and regulatory challenges, notably antitrust investigations, intellectual property disputes, and privacy laws, which vary internationally and are continually evolving. Compared to more stable industry environments, the tech sector faces frequent regulatory scrutiny regarding market dominance, data protection, and app distribution policies. These legal risks are cyclical, often intensifying in response to technological or market developments, and can result in significant penalties, business restrictions, or mandates to alter business practices. Quantitative aspects include the possibility of hefty fines or mandated changes that could diminish revenue from services or necessitate costly operational modifications. Apple\u2019s protections involve compliance programs, engagement with regulators, and geographical diversification, but the unpredictable and politically charged nature of the legal landscape means vulnerabilities remain.\n\nIn sum, Apple\u2019s risk landscape is layered and interconnected, characterized by external macroeconomic and geopolitical vulnerabilities, rapid technological change leading to fierce industry competition, and a complex regulatory environment that can swiftly impact business practices. Its sizable financial resources, strategic diversification, and innovation efforts provide some protections, but many risks\u2014particularly those driven by geopolitics and regulation\u2014are beyond direct control. To navigate this landscape successfully, Apple must continuously adapt its supply chains, innovate ahead of competitors, and engage proactively with regulators, understanding that some risks can only be mitigated rather than fully eliminated. Recognizing this nuanced risk profile underscores the importance of agility, diversification, and vigilant risk management for sustained long-term success.\n", "output": "**Risk Assessment**\n\nApple Inc. faces a multifaceted risk environment characterized by significant challenges stemming from global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, fierce industry competition driven by rapid technological innovation, and an increasingly complex legal and regulatory landscape.\n\nFirst, Apple\u2019s extensive international operations expose it to considerable macroeconomic and geopolitical risks. The company\u2019s reliance on global supply chains\u2014predominantly centered in Asia\u2014and its broad international customer base make it vulnerable to currency fluctuations, trade restrictions, tariffs, and political tensions such as the ongoing US-China dispute. Such factors can disrupt manufacturing processes, increase operational costs, and dampen consumer demand in key markets. Additionally, the concentration of manufacturing facilities in regions prone to natural disasters like earthquakes further amplifies the risk of supply interruptions. Although Apple actively mitigates these risks through supplier diversification and currency hedging strategies, the uncontrollable and often unpredictable nature of geopolitical and environmental factors means that complete risk elimination is not possible.\n\nSecond, the technology sector\u2019s inherent volatility and competitiveness present continuous challenges. Apple competes in markets characterized by aggressive pricing, rapid product cycles, and relentless innovation pressures. Technology products can quickly become outdated as new advancements emerge, intensifying the threat of losing market share to competitors who may introduce more advanced or cost-effective solutions. While Apple leverages its integrated ecosystem, substantial research and development investments, and intellectual property protections to maintain an edge, these measures provide only partial insulation. Risks include declining profit margins from competitive pricing pressures, potential lagging in technological breakthroughs, and legal disputes over patent infringements. Given the speed of innovation and evolving customer expectations, Apple must constantly innovate and adapt to sustain its leadership position.\n\nThird, Apple navigates a complicated and evolving legal and regulatory environment. The company faces increasing scrutiny related to antitrust issues, intellectual property rights, and data privacy regulations that vary across regions and frequently change in response to shifts in technology and market dynamics. Unlike sectors with more stable frameworks, the technology industry undergoes cyclical regulatory reviews that can impose significant penalties, operational constraints, or necessitate costly changes to business practices, particularly concerning app store policies and user privacy protections. Apple counters these risks through comprehensive compliance initiatives, active engagement with global regulators, and geographical diversification to spread regulatory exposure. Nonetheless, the unpredictable, politically charged nature of these legal challenges means vulnerabilities persist.\n\nIn summary, Apple\u2019s risk profile reflects an intricate interplay of external macroeconomic and geopolitical vulnerabilities, fierce sector competition accentuated by rapid technological change, and an uncertain regulatory environment. Its strong financial base, strategic diversification, and innovation strengths confer important protections, but many risks\u2014especially those linked to geopolitical tensions and regulatory shifts\u2014are beyond its full control. Successfully managing this environment requires Apple to maintain supply chain agility, persistently innovate, and engage proactively with policymakers. Acknowledging that some risks can only be mitigated rather than eradicated highlights the critical importance of continuous adaptability and vigilant risk management for Apple\u2019s sustained growth and resilience.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Recognizing this nuanced risk profile underscores the importance of agility, diversification, and vigilant risk management for sustained long-term success.\n\n\n-- get_competitors_analysis --\nBased on the provided financial metrics, it is evident that the company with a market capitalization of approximately $3 trillion USD and a book value per share of $3.71 is currently facing limited transparency regarding its recent operational performance. The absence of explicit figures for EBITDA margin, EBITDA, free cash flow (FCF) conversion, revenue, and revenue growth over multiple years makes it challenging to identify clear trends or assess the company's trajectory. Without year-over-year data, we cannot determine whether these key profitability and efficiency metrics are improving, stable, or declining.\n\nIf we consider typical company performance patterns, consistent improvements in EBITDA margin, revenue growth, and FCF conversion would indicate a healthy, efficiently managed business, often justifying a high valuation. Conversely, declining margins, stagnating revenues, or deteriorating cash flow metrics would raise concerns about sustainability and could justify skepticism towards the current market cap. Since such data is missing, a definitive trend analysis is not feasible.\n\nIn a competitive context, comparing this firm to its peers would typically involve examining how its EBITDA margins and EV/EBITDA ratios stack against industry averages. For example, a high EV/EBITDA ratio relative to competitors could suggest overvaluation unless supported by superior growth prospects or strategic advantages. Conversely, a lower valuation might imply market doubts about its profitability or growth potential. Without concrete competitor figures, however, such comparisons remain speculative.\n\nFocusing on valuation metrics, the EV/EBITDA ratio provides insights into how the market values the company's earnings relative to its enterprise value. Given the market cap magnitude but the lack of recent earnings data, it is difficult to determine whether the company is overvalued or undervalued. A high EV/EBITDA might indicate expectations of future growth, but it could also suggest overpricing if profitability and cash flows are declining or stagnant, which seems probable given the limited data.\n\nRegarding profitability and efficiency insights, the missing EBITDA margins and FCF conversion data hinder precise assessment. Should recent margins be low or shrinking relative to historical levels, it would point to decreasing profitability, whereas stable or improving margins would support the current valuation. Similarly, the absence of income and cash flow trends prevents detailed analysis of return on invested capital (ROIC), though high ROIC typically signals effective use of capital and supports higher valuations.\n\nRevenue and revenue growth are crucial for understanding the company's market position and future potential. Without recent figures, any judgment on growth trends is speculative. Historically, companies with consistent revenue growth tend to command premium valuations, especially if growth accelerates; stagnation or decline could undermine investor confidence.\n\nIn conclusion, the overall financial health of this entity appears uncertain based on the limited data available. The enormous market cap suggests positive market sentiment, likely driven by expectations of future growth, strategic positioning, or market perception. However, the lack of recent detailed financial performance metrics hampers a thorough evaluation. If the company\u2019s core profitability, cash flow efficiency, and revenue growth are weak or declining, the current valuation and EV/EBITDA multiple could be seen as overoptimistic or inflated, contradicting fundamentals. Conversely, if underlying metrics are healthy and trending favorably, the valuation might be justified. Ultimately, comprehensive, transparent financial disclosure remains critical for meaningful assessment and accurate valuation justification.\n", "output": "Apple Inc. continues to solidify its position as a global technology leader by expertly blending innovation, brand loyalty, and a comprehensive ecosystem of hardware, software, and services. Since its inception in 1976, Apple has evolved into a powerhouse offering flagship products such as the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and wearables, supported by a fast-growing services segment that includes the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. This integrated approach not only drives recurring revenue streams but also fosters strong customer retention and premium pricing \u2014 key advantages in a fiercely competitive market.\n\nIn 2023, Apple\u2019s financial performance revealed a mixed yet largely resilient picture amid a challenging backdrop. Total revenue marginally declined by 3% year-over-year to $383.3 billion. Notably, iPhone sales dipped 2%, primarily reflecting reduced demand for non-Pro models, although Pro versions saw increased traction. This indicates a consumer shift towards higher-end devices despite tightening market conditions. The Mac segment suffered a pronounced 27% decrease, impacted by saturated markets, intensifying competition, and macroeconomic headwinds constraining enterprise and consumer purchasing decisions. The iPad and wearables, home, and accessories categories both experienced modest declines of 3%, symptomatic of market saturation and evolving consumer preferences. Offsetting these hardware trends, Apple\u2019s Services division grew robustly by 9%, reaching $85.2 billion in revenue, underscoring the company\u2019s strategic emphasis on subscription and digital offerings that enhance ecosystem engagement and generate stable recurring income.\n\nDespite these revenue pressures, Apple maintained strong profitability and operational efficiency. Gross profit stood at $169.1 billion with a stable gross margin of 44.1%, reflecting effective cost management and an improved product mix favoring higher-margin offerings. Operating income was a robust $123.2 billion, leading to net income of $93.7 billion, or roughly a 24% net profit margin. Diluted earnings per share of $6.08 further affirmed investor confidence. Apple\u2019s solid cash generation facilitated capital expenditures of $9.45 billion to sustain innovation and manufacturing capabilities, while liquidity remained ample with $148.3 billion in cash reserves. However, aggressive shareholder returns, including a $90 billion share repurchase authorization and $15.2 billion in dividends, contributed to a slight net cash reduction, highlighting a balance between rewarding investors and preserving financial flexibility.\n\nThe company\u2019s balance sheet underscores financial strength, featuring approximately $365 billion in total assets and current assets exceeding short-term liabilities, indicative of sound liquidity. Long-term debt of approximately $85.75 billion remains manageable given healthy shareholders\u2019 equity near $57 billion, demonstrating prudent leverage and capital allocation strategies that support continued growth and operational resilience.\n\nLooking forward, Apple\u2019s strategic innovation pipeline remains robust and diversified with recent launches such as the iPhone 15 series, the Apple Vision Pro spatial computing platform, and new Mac models. These introduce fresh growth catalysts amid emerging industry trends like AI, spatial computing, and 5G adoption. Nonetheless, Apple faces notable risks: geopolitical tensions, especially between the U.S. and China, pose supply chain vulnerabilities given manufacturing concentration in Asia; macroeconomic volatility and currency fluctuations threaten consumer spending power; and intensifying competition demands relentless innovation to maintain market share. Moreover, evolving legal and regulatory landscapes\u2014particularly in antitrust, intellectual property, and data privacy\u2014could impose compliance costs or restrict business practices, affecting services revenue and operational flexibility.\n\nCompetitive analysis, while hindered by limited public data on Apple\u2019s EBITDA margins and cash flow conversion, suggests that the company\u2019s valuation near $3 trillion reflects market confidence in its differentiated ecosystem, remarkable profitability, and growth prospects. Still, a lack of transparent multi-year financial trends introduces some uncertainty regarding the sustainability of revenue growth and operational efficiency relative to peers in the dynamic technology sector.\n\nIn essence, Apple embodies a resilient, innovation-driven enterprise whose diversified product offerings and expanding services ecosystem provide a formidable fortress against headwinds. Its sustained profitability, robust cash flow, and aggressive capital return programs demonstrate financial discipline and shareholder focus. Nevertheless, navigating a complex risk landscape marked by geopolitical, competitive, and regulatory challenges will be critical. Success will hinge on Apple\u2019s ability to continue pioneering industry-leading technologies, enhance supply chain resilience, and capitalize on emergent digital growth avenues to generate long-term shareholder value in an increasingly complex global environment.", "tool": "summarize"}}

Stay strictly within 500-600 words. Synthesize, clarify, and avoid repetition.\n\nSections:\n-- get_competitors_analysis --\nBased on the provided financial metrics, it is evident that the company with a market capitalization of approximately $3 trillion USD and a book value per share of $3.71 is currently facing limited transparency regarding its recent operational performance. The absence of explicit figures for EBITDA margin, EBITDA, free cash flow (FCF) conversion, revenue, and revenue growth over multiple years makes it challenging to identify clear trends or assess the company's trajectory. Without year-over-year data, we cannot determine whether these key profitability and efficiency metrics are improving, stable, or declining.\n\nIf we consider typical company performance patterns, consistent improvements in EBITDA margin, revenue growth, and FCF conversion would indicate a healthy, efficiently managed business, often justifying a high valuation. Conversely, declining margins, stagnating revenues, or deteriorating cash flow metrics would raise concerns about sustainability and could justify skepticism towards the current market cap. Since such data is missing, a definitive trend analysis is not feasible.\n\nIn a competitive context, comparing this firm to its peers would typically involve examining how its EBITDA margins and EV/EBITDA ratios stack against industry averages. For example, a high EV/EBITDA ratio relative to competitors could suggest overvaluation unless supported by superior growth prospects or strategic advantages. Conversely, a lower valuation might imply market doubts about its profitability or growth potential. Without concrete competitor figures, however, such comparisons remain speculative.\n\nFocusing on valuation metrics, the EV/EBITDA ratio provides insights into how the market values the company's earnings relative to its enterprise value. Given the market cap magnitude but the lack of recent earnings data, it is difficult to determine whether the company is overvalued or undervalued. A high EV/EBITDA might indicate expectations of future growth, but it could also suggest overpricing if profitability and cash flows are declining or stagnant, which seems probable given the limited data.\n\nRegarding profitability and efficiency insights, the missing EBITDA margins and FCF conversion data hinder precise assessment. Should recent margins be low or shrinking relative to historical levels, it would point to decreasing profitability, whereas stable or improving margins would support the current valuation. Similarly, the absence of income and cash flow trends prevents detailed analysis of return on invested capital (ROIC), though high ROIC typically signals effective use of capital and supports higher valuations.\n\nRevenue and revenue growth are crucial for understanding the company's market position and future potential. Without recent figures, any judgment on growth trends is speculative. Historically, companies with consistent revenue growth tend to command premium valuations, especially if growth accelerates; stagnation or decline could undermine investor confidence.\n\nIn conclusion, the overall financial health of this entity appears uncertain based on the limited data available. The enormous market cap suggests positive market sentiment, likely driven by expectations of future growth, strategic positioning, or market perception. However, the lack of recent detailed financial performance metrics hampers a thorough evaluation. If the company\u2019s core profitability, cash flow efficiency, and revenue growth are weak or declining, the current valuation and EV/EBITDA multiple could be seen as overoptimistic or inflated, contradicting fundamentals. Conversely, if underlying metrics are healthy and trending favorably, the valuation might be justified. Ultimately, comprehensive, transparent financial disclosure remains critical for meaningful assessment and accurate valuation justification.\n", "output": "Competitors Analysis\n\nApple Inc. stands as one of the most valuable companies globally, with a market capitalization nearing $3 trillion USD. This towering valuation reflects substantial market confidence in its strategic positioning, innovation capabilities, and growth potential. However, a meaningful evaluation of Apple\u2019s competitive standing is hindered by the absence of detailed and up-to-date financial indicators such as EBITDA margin, EBITDA figures, free cash flow (FCF) conversion, revenue, and revenue growth metrics. This lack of transparency restricts the ability to analyze Apple\u2019s operational efficiency and profitability trends comprehensively, making it difficult to draw objective conclusions regarding its performance relative to industry peers.\n\nTypically, competitive analysis involves examining profitability, cash flow efficiency, growth, and valuation ratios. For a technology giant like Apple, EBITDA margin and FCF conversion rates are key metrics that reveal its capacity to convert revenues into operating profits and free cash flow\u2014critical for funding innovation, capital expenditures, and shareholder returns. Without these measures, investors and analysts cannot definitively ascertain whether Apple is experiencing margin expansion indicative of stronger operational control, or if margins are compressing due to competitive pressures or changing market dynamics.\n\nValuation multiples, especially the enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio, provide important insights into how the market prices a company\u2019s earnings relative to its total enterprise value. A higher EV/EBITDA multiple often signals that the market expects future growth or recognizes competitive advantages, while a lower multiple might reflect skepticism about profitability or growth sustainability. Given the absence of explicit EBITDA and enterprise valuation data, interpreting Apple\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio is speculative, leaving questions about whether the market\u2019s premium valuation is fundamentally justified or overly optimistic.\n\nIn a competitive context, Apple benefits from its diversified ecosystem encompassing hardware, software, and services, which historically has driven stable revenue growth and high returns on invested capital (ROIC). Such attributes usually support premium valuations compared to competitors, many of which may have less integrated business models or less brand strength. However, without current data on revenue levels and growth rates, it remains unclear if Apple\u2019s momentum continues unabated or if it faces emerging challenges that could moderate its growth prospects.\n\nROIC is another critical measure demonstrating efficient resource deployment and value creation. If Apple continues to generate returns exceeding its cost of capital, that would justify the elevated market capitalization. Conversely, declines in ROIC or erosion of profitability metrics could indicate market overvaluation. The absence of these data points limits precise appraisal in either direction and hinders effective benchmarking against peers.\n\nWhile Apple\u2019s scale and brand equity often afford it a notable premium in valuation relative to competitors, some peers may post superior EBITDA margins or exhibit faster revenue growth, potentially signaling shifts in competitive dynamics. Nevertheless, without direct comparable financial data of competitors, such relative assessments remain conjectural.\n\nIn summary, Apple's extraordinary market capitalization reflects investor optimism anchored in its strategic strengths and historical performance. Yet, the limited availability of recent detailed financial performance indicators restricts conclusive competitive analysis and valuation assessment. The sustainability of Apple's market leadership will hinge on continued profitability, strong cash flow generation, and consistent revenue growth amid evolving market conditions. Greater transparency in financial disclosures is essential to substantiate whether the current valuation aligns with fundamental performance or represents an elevated premium based on future expectations.", "tool": "summarize"}}
