and Analysis
ECONOMIC OVERVIEW
The Indian economy grew by an estimated 7.6% in FY 2023-24 as 
compared to 7.0% in the previous financial year. (Source: Ministry of 
Statistics & Programme Implementation). Geopolitical uncertainties 
and supply chain constraints continued to be the key challenges 
externally for the country, however, robust spending in the domestic 
economy backed by policy support ensured economic resilience.
Outlook
GDP growth is expected to moderate to 6.8% (Source: CRISIL 
Research) in fiscal 2025 as fiscal consolidation, rising borrowing 
costs and tighter regulatory measures weigh on demand. 
Additionally, heightened geopolitical uncertainties weigh in on 
the overall growth prospects. On the other hand, another spell of 
normal monsoon and easing inflation could revive rural demand 
for India.
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
The overall retail industry is estimated to have grown at 11% 
to ` 93 trillion in FY 2023-24. Organised retail is estimated to 
have grown at 16% to ` 11 trillion (~11.8% of the overall retail 
industry) while E-retail is estimated to have grown at 20% to ` 3.6 
trillion (~3.9% of the overall retail industry). Of the total organised 
retail industry, the food and grocery segment accounts for 
about 20% (in value terms) as of FY 2023-24. Retail industry is 
estimated to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 10-
11% between 2024 and 2028 as economic activity picks up and

inflation remains in a low to moderate range. Improvement in the 
macroeconomic environment backed by increase in consumer 
spending in the longer-term auger well for the Retail Industry.
