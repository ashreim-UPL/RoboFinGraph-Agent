EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF 
CSR PROJECTS:
Dakshana India Education Trust
Education is a fundamental right, yet economic disparities often 
limit access to quality educational opportunities. Offering free 
coaching levels the playing field, ensuring that students from all 
socio-economic backgrounds have an equal chance to pursue 
higher education and professional success. Education is also 
one of the most effective tools for breaking the cycle of poverty. 
By empowering students from low-income backgrounds with 
the skills and knowledge needed to succeed academically, they 
are better equipped to secure high-paying jobs and improve 
their socio-economic status. Many bright and talented students 
from low-income families do not have access to the resources or 
guidance to excel in competitive exams like JEE/NEET. Such a 
programme allows the society to tap into this pool of meritorious 
students.
DMart has been extending support to Dakshana India Education 
Trust (henceforth, Dakshana) since 2021-22. Dakshana is a 
philanthropic foundation with a mission centred around the 
idea that education is the most powerful and enduring weapon 
to win the battle against poverty. Dakshana helps bright and 
impoverished students, predominantly from rural India, to prepare 
for engineering and medical entrance(competitive) exams. 
Dakshana has been offering free coaching scholarships to less 
advantaged students from government schools to prepare for
impoverished students, predominantly from rural India, to prepare 
for engineering and medical entrance(competitive) exams. 
Dakshana has been offering free coaching scholarships to less 
advantaged students from government schools to prepare for 
competitive exams such as JEE/ NEET/ AIIMS for over 17 years 
with great success. This project is in alignment with DMart vision 
of supporting the education of underprivileged children. This 
initiative promotes social cohesion and inclusivity. An amount of 
` 2.5 crore was disbursed for contribution towards scholarship 
for students’ coaching, access to educational resources and 
residential accommodation. The intervention addresses SDG 4 of 
the UN SDGs, Agenda 2030. Nationally, it targets activity (ii) of 
Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013.
As part of the impact assessment, a qualitative approach was 
deployed to evaluate project progress and analyse areas of 
impact emerging out of the interactions with the key stakeholders. 
A  sample size of 86 was covered that involved conducting surveys 
with the students and their parents and key informant interviews 
(KIIs) with the Dakshana team and the DMart team as part of the 
assessment.
Under the project, scholarships are provided to the selected 
students appearing for JEE/NEET exams. The programme has 
been delivered through residential coaching at the Dakshana 
Valley for an academic year. Through the programme, students
Under the project, scholarships are provided to the selected 
students appearing for JEE/NEET exams. The programme has 
been delivered through residential coaching at the Dakshana 
Valley for an academic year. Through the programme, students 
were provided with free residential coaching for preparation of 
JEE and NEET entrance exams; along with access to educational 
resources. 200 students were sponsored by DMart as part of this 
initiative in 2022-23. 82% of the sponsored students qualified 
for IIT and 83% of the sponsored students qualified for various 
government medical colleges in the previous year with the support 
of Dakshana.
No major challenges related to project execution were reported or 
observed. Few challenges reported were lack of practical-based 
learning in the course and low adoption of digital resources. The 
enrolment of girl students, especially for the engineering (JEE) 
course is low owing to societal norms and cultural restrictions 
on female mobility. Recommendations for adopting teaching 
methods with a higher focus on practical learning, integrating 
digital resources in the course curriculum and ensuring teachers 
do not leave mid-session have been given.
Navneet 21 Question Paper Set
Access to educational resources is often limited for students 
from low-income families, contributing to educational disparities. 
Providing question paper sets to government school students for 
their SSC board examinations not only reduces such disparities
from low-income families, contributing to educational disparities.

but also ensures that all students have access to the tools they 
need to succeed academically. It promotes equity and social justice 
and is a strategic investment in the future prosperity and well-
being of the nation. Empowering these students and improving 
their educational outcomes will allow them to pursue academic 
success, thereby opening up opportunities for their future.
DMart has been extending support to government school 
students through the distribution of the Navneet 21 Question 
Paper Set for their 10 th-grade board exam preparation since 
academic year 2015-16. The Navneet 21 Question Paper Set is 
a series of question papers published by Navneet Publications, a 
well-known publishing house in India. These sets typically consist 
of a comprehensive collection of question papers in all subjects, 
aligned with the curriculum, designed to help students prepare for 
board examinations. The Navneet 21 Question Paper Set serves 
as a valuable resource for students, offering comprehensive 
coverage, diverse question types, and aligned content to support 
exam preparation and success. DMart spent an amount of ` 1.07 
crore for the academic year 2022-23 on this initiative targeted at 
the students at government schools. This intervention addresses
exam preparation and success. DMart spent an amount of ` 1.07 
crore for the academic year 2022-23 on this initiative targeted at 
the students at government schools. This intervention addresses 
SDG 4 of the UN SDGs, Agenda 2030. Nationally, it targets activity 
(ii) of Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013.
As part of the impact assessment, a qualitative approach was 
deployed to evaluate project progress and analyse areas of 
impact emerging out of the interactions with the key stakeholders 
A sample size of 253 was covered involving conducting surveys 
with the students, and their parents and key informant interviews 
(KIIs) with the school teachers and the DMart team as part of the 
assessment.
Under the project, Navneet Question Banks are distributed to 
government school students to aid SSC board exam preparation. 
The Question Banks have been distributed by DMart at the 
identified government schools of Mumbai, Thane, Aurangabad, 
and Kolhapur. 23,235 students were sponsored as part of this 
initiative in FY 2022-23. Majority of the students are pursuing 
higher education (in Science, Commerce and Humanities) across 
different junior colleges.

(A) Conservation of energy
Steps taken 
or impact on 
conservation of 
energy
The operations of the Company are not energy intensive. However, in its efforts to conserve energy, adequate 
measures have been taken in the new and the pre-existing stores. Some of these initiatives are:
 •   Green Building Certification: We strive to obtain Green Building Certification for our stores under 
Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) or US Green Building Council (USGBC). A significant effort has been 
made throughout a building’s life-cycle from the time of construction to demolition which ensures minimal 
environmental impact. We continued to increase Green Building Certifications for our stores. We have 
obtained 217 certifications thus far (38 buildings with Gold certification under US GBC LEED, 1 building with 
Gold Certification under Indian GBC LEED, and 178 buildings with Gold Certification under Indian GBC).
 •   Energy efficient air-conditioning: We use BEE Star rated split air conditioners, which consume less 
energy in comparison to conventional air conditioners  We continued using energy efficient inverter air 
conditioners at select locations.
 •  Eco-Friendly Speed Breakers: To maintain safe vehicular movement within our premises we install speed
energy in comparison to conventional air conditioners  We continued using energy efficient inverter air 
conditioners at select locations.
 •  Eco-Friendly Speed Breakers: To maintain safe vehicular movement within our premises we install speed 
breakers at strategic points. We have installed the speed breakers made up of composite material which 
has a combination of recycled plastic, concrete waste and rubber waste. For the year FY 2023-24, we have 
installed 6,631 meters of recycled speed breakers instead of the conventional PVC speed breakers This 
cumulatively consists of 96% of the total speed breakers installed at our premises last year.
•   Hydraulic Baling Press Machines:  We have installed hydraulic baling machines at 255 locations for 
plastic compaction. These baling machines present multiple benefits like no loose plastic littering, good 
hygiene and reduced transportation frequency. This initiative helps in reducing the Scope 3 emissions.
•   Energy Monitoring Systems (IOT): Our stores are equipped with IOT Ecosystem that helps in monitoring 
several of our energy consuming equipment and recommends basis alerts on early warnings of possible 
breakdowns and energy conservation possibilities.
•   Natural Gas Generators: Some of our stores have been equipped with Natural Gas Generators  They 
produce no particulate matter, relatively lesser emissions and lower noise pollution vis-a-vis diesel generators
•   Natural Gas Generators: Some of our stores have been equipped with Natural Gas Generators  They 
produce no particulate matter, relatively lesser emissions and lower noise pollution vis-a-vis diesel generators 
 •   CPCB-IV Compliant Diesel Generator Sets: We have commenced installation of CPCB-IV compliant 
Diesel Generator Sets at some of our stores. These produce relatively lesser emissions vis-a-vis the previous 
generation of DG’s.
•   Retrofit Emissions Control Device (RECD): We continued installation of RECD and Dual Fuel kit for some 
of our legacy diesel generators at select locations. These devices can capture Particulate Matter Carbon from 
polluting the air with more than 70% efficiency.
For details please refer ‘Environmental Focus at Dmart’ at page no. 12 of the Annual Report.
Steps taken by the 
Company for utilising 
alternate sources of 
energy
We have commissioned 36 solar plants in FY 2023-24 with a capacity of 8.2 MW. In total we have 226 solar 
plants with cumulative capacity of 36.0 MW from these installations. Of the total energy requirement at these 
226 premises, 24.1% (FY 2022-23: 21.8%) is met through Solar Energy. Subject to on-ground feasibility, it is our 
endeavour to ensure that all our new premises have a solar plant installed. We have also commenced installing 
rooftop solar plants at some of our distribution and production centers Further, we have installed car ports at
