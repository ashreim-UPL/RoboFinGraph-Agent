AUM represents the broad range of financial assets managed for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which BlackRock provides risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice, or assets that the Company is retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis. 

Investment management fees are typically earned as a percentage of AUM. BlackRock also earns performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, the Company also may earn securities lending revenue. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietary Aladdin investment system as well as risk management, outsourcing, advisory and other technology services, to institutional investors and wealth management intermediaries. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users, implementation go-lives and software solution delivery and support.

At December 31, 2021, total AUM was $10.01 trillion, representing a CAGR of 14% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net inflows and acquisitions, including the First Reserve Transaction, which added $3.3 billion of AUM in 2017, the net AUM impact from the TCP Transaction, the Citibanamex Transaction, the Aegon Transaction and the DSP Transaction, which added $27.5 billion of AUM in 2018, and the Aperio Transaction, which added $41.3 billion of AUM in February 2021. Our AUM mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range, as described below.

&#160;

The Company considers the categorization of its AUM by client type, product type, investment style, and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Company&#8217;s AUM will be organized as follows:

Client Type 

BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, with a regionally focused business model. BlackRock leverages the benefits of scale across global investment, risk and technology platforms while at the same time using local distribution presence to deliver solutions for clients. Furthermore, our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent. &#160; 

Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments&#59; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities&#59; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail intermediaries.

ETFs are a growing component of both institutional and retail client portfolios. However, as ETFs are traded on exchanges, complete transparency on the ultimate end-client is unavailable. Therefore, ETFs are presented as a separate client type below, with investments in ETFs by institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections.

Retail 

BlackRock serves retail investors globally through a wide array of vehicles across the investment spectrum, including separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and private investment funds. Retail investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Technology solutions, digital distribution tools and a shift toward portfolio construction are increasing the number of financial advisors and end-retail investors using BlackRock products. 

Retail represented 11% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2021 and 34% of long-term investment advisory and administration fees (collectively &#8220;base fees&#8221;) and securities lending revenue for 2021. 

ETFs have a significant retail component but are shown separately below. With the exclusion of ETFs, retail AUM is predominantly comprised of active mutual funds. Mutual funds totaled $841.4 billion, or 81%, of retail long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts. 82% of retail long-term AUM is invested in active products.

Amounts include AUM attributable to the Aperio Transaction. 

##TABLE_END

The retail client base is diversified geographically, with 67% of long-term AUM managed for investors based in the Americas, 28% in EMEA and 5% in Asia-Pacific at year-end 2021. 

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

US retail long-term net inflows of $59.7 billion were led by equity and fixed income net inflows of $24.1 billion and $20.6 billion, respectively. Equity net inflows were led by flows into US growth, technology and global equities franchises. Fixed income net inflows were diversified across exposures and products, with strong flows into unconstrained, municipal and total return bond offerings. Alternatives net inflows of $9.1 billion were driven by flows into the BlackRock Alternative Capital Strategies and Global Event Driven funds. Multi-asset net inflows of $5.9 billion included the successful close of the $2.1 billion BlackRock ESG Capital Allocation Trust. 

##TABLE_END

In the first quarter of 2021, BlackRock closed the acquisition of Aperio, a pioneer in customizing tax-optimized index equity separately managed accounts (&#8220;SMA&#8221;), to enhance its wealth platform and provide whole-portfolio solutions to ultra-high net worth advisors. The combination of Aperio with BlackRock&#8217;s existing SMA franchise expands the breadth of personalization capabilities available to wealth managers from BlackRock via tax-managed strategies across factors, broad market indexing, and investor Environmental, Social, and Governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) preferences across all asset classes. In the third quarter of 2021, BlackRock made a minority investment in SpiderRock Advisors, a tech-enabled asset manager focused on providing professionally managed option overlay strategies. The Company expects this investment to add incremental product capabilities to Aperio and support expansion of its personalized SMA franchise. 

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

International retail long-term net inflows of $42.4 billion were led by equity net inflows of $18.0 billion, reflecting strong flows into index equity mutual funds, and our natural resources and technology active equity franchises. In addition, equity net inflows reflected $1.4 billion raised from the launch of BlackRock&#8217;s wholly owned Fund Management Company (&#8220;FMC&#8221;) and Wealth Management Company (&#8220;WMC&#8221;) joint venture in China. Fixed income net inflows of $14.3 billion were driven by flows into index fixed income mutual funds and Asia bond strategies. Multi-asset net inflows of $6.6 billion were led by flows into ESG and world allocation strategies. Alternatives net inflows of $3.5 billion reflected demand for BlackRock&#8217;s Global Event Driven fund.

##TABLE_END

ETFs

BlackRock is the leading ETF provider in the world with $3.3 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2021, and generated record net inflows of $305.5 billion in 2021. The majority of ETF AUM and net inflows represent the Company&#8217;s index-tracking iShares-branded ETFs. The Company also offers a select number of active BlackRock-branded ETFs that seek outperformance and/or differentiated outcomes.

Equity ETF net inflows of $222.9 billion were driven by flows into core and sustainable ETFs, as well as continued client use of BlackRock&#8217;s broad-based precision exposure ETFs to express risk-on sentiment during the year. Fixed income ETF net inflows of $78.9 billion were diversified across exposures, led by flows into inflation-protected, core and municipal bond funds. Multi-asset and alternative ETFs contributed a combined $3.8 billion of net inflows, primarily into core allocation and commodities funds.

ETFs represented 35% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2021 and 41% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2021.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

Institutional active AUM ended 2021 at $1.8 trillion, reflecting $169.1 billion of net inflows, driven by broad-based strength across all product categories, the funding of several significant outsourced chief investment officer (&#8220;OCIO&#8221;) mandates and continued growth in our LifePath&#174; target-date franchise. 

&#160;

Alternatives net inflows of $15.8 billion were led by inflows into private credit, infrastructure, real estate and private equity. Excluding return of capital and investment of $8.3 billion, alternatives net inflows were $24.1 billion. In addition, 2021 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives. In 2021, BlackRock raised a record $42 billion of client capital, which includes both net inflows and non-fee paying commitments raised. At year-end, BlackRock had approximately $36 billion of non-fee-earning committed capital to deploy for institutional clients, which is not included in AUM.

&#160;

Institutional active represented 19% of long-term AUM and 18% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2021.

Institutional index AUM totaled $3.2 trillion at December 31, 2021, reflecting $117.8 billion of net outflows which included a $58 billion low-fee redemption in the second quarter. Equity net outflows of $169.3 billion also reflected clients rebalancing portfolios after significant equity market gains, or tactically shifting assets to fixed income and cash. Fixed income net inflows of $52.4 billion were driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions. 

Institutional index represented 35% of long-term AUM and 7% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2021.

The Company&#8217;s institutional clients consist of the following: 

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Pensions, Foundations and Endowments. BlackRock is among the world&#8217;s largest managers of pension plan assets with $3.2 trillion, or 65%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2021. The market landscape continues to shift from defined benefit to defined contribution, and our defined contribution channel represented $1.4 trillion of total pension AUM. BlackRock remains well positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $96.0 billion, or 2%, of long-term institutional AUM was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Official Institutions. BlackRock managed $316.4 billion, or 7%, of long-term institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2021. These clients often require specialized investment advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Financial and Other Institutions. BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $507.8 billion, or 10%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end 2021. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which the Company provides sub-advisory services, totaled $797.3 billion, or 16%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.

##TABLE_END

Long-term product offerings include alpha-seeking active and index strategies. Our alpha-seeking active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. In contrast, index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Index strategies include both our non-ETF index products and ETFs. 

Although many clients use both alpha-seeking active and index strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. Net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on BlackRock&#8217;s revenues and earnings. 

Equity 

Year-end 2021 equity AUM totaled $5.3 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $101.7 billion. Net inflows included $222.9 billion and $48.8 billion into ETFs and active, respectively, partially offset by non-ETF index net outflows of $170.0 billion. Record active equity net inflows were driven by flows into US growth, technology and global fundamental equities franchises, as well as flows into quantitative strategies.

BlackRock&#8217;s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock&#8217;s equity AUM is tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than US equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which may not consistently move in tandem with US markets, have a greater impact on BlackRock&#8217;s equity revenues and effective fee rate. 

Equity represented 58% of long-term AUM and 54% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2021.

Fixed Income 

Fixed income AUM ended 2021 at $2.8 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $230.3 billion. Net inflows included $94.0 billion, $78.9 billion and $57.4 billion in active, ETFs and non-ETF index, respectively. Record active fixed income net inflows of $94.0 billion reflected the funding of a significant core fixed income mandate in the fourth quarter, as well as strong flows into unconstrained, municipal, total return and Asia bond offerings.

Fixed income represented 30% of long-term AUM and 26% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2021.

&#160;

Multi-Asset 

BlackRock manages a variety of multi-asset balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities, bonds, currencies and commodities, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions may include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays. 

Multi-asset represented 9% of long-term AUM and 10% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2021.

Component changes in multi-asset AUM for 2021 are presented below.

##TABLE_END

Multi-asset net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $83.0 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients. Defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows and contributed $53.5 billion to institutional multi-asset net inflows in 2021, primarily into target date and target risk product offerings. 

The Company&#8217;s multi-asset strategies include the following: 

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Target date and target risk products generated net inflows of $30.5 billion. Institutional investors represented 90% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans representing 84% of AUM. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our LifePath offerings. LifePath products utilize a proprietary active asset allocation overlay model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor&#8217;s expected retirement timing. Underlying investments are primarily index products. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Asset allocation and balanced products generated $37.2 billion of net inflows. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Flagship products include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income fund families. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Fiduciary management services are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of investment management, often with BlackRock acting as outsourced chief investment officer. These customized services require strong partnership with the clients&#8217; investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives. Fiduciary net inflows of $30.1 billion reflected the funding of several significant OCIO mandates. 

##TABLE_END

Alternatives 

BlackRock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing high-alpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing. Our alternatives products fall into three main categories &#8212; 1) illiquid alternatives, 2) liquid alternatives, and 3) currency and commodities. Illiquid alternatives include offerings in alternative solutions, private equity, opportunistic and credit, real estate and infrastructure. Liquid alternatives include offerings in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions (funds of funds).

&#160;

In 2021, liquid and illiquid alternatives generated a combined $27.4 billion of net inflows, or $36.6 billion excluding return of capital/investment of $9.2 billion. The largest contributors to return of capital/investment were opportunistic and credit strategies, private equity solutions and infrastructure. Net inflows were driven by direct hedge funds, private equity, infrastructure and opportunistic and credit strategies. At year-end, BlackRock had approximately $36 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded, uninvested commitments, which are expected to be deployed in future years&#59; these commitments are not included in AUM or flows until they are fee-paying. Currency and commodities saw $1.6 billion of net inflows, primarily into commodities ETFs.

&#160;

BlackRock believes that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies, investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings. BlackRock&#8217;s highly diversified alternatives franchise is well positioned to continue to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors. 

Alternatives represented 3% of long-term AUM and 10% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2021.

&#160;

Component changes in alternatives AUM for 20 2 1 are presented in the table below.

Illiquid Alternatives

The Company&#8217;s illiquid alternatives strategies include the following:

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Alternative Solutions represents highly customized portfolios of alternative investments. In 2021, alternative solutions portfolios had $6.0 billion in AUM, and $1.4 billion of net inflows. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Private Equity and Opportunistic included AUM of $19.4 billion in private equity solutions, $19.3 billion in opportunistic and credit offerings, and $3.5 billion in Long Term Private Capital (&#8220;LTPC&#8221;). Net inflows of $9.1 billion into private equity and opportunistic strategies included $6.3 billion of net inflows into opportunistic and credit offerings and $2.8 billion of net inflows into private equity solutions. 

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#8226; 

Real Assets , which includes infrastructure and real estate, totaled $54.4 billion in AUM, reflecting net inflows of $5.7 billion, led by infrastructure capital raise and deployments. 

##TABLE_END

Liquid Alternatives

The Company&#8217;s liquid alternatives products&#8217; net inflows of $11.3 billion reflected net inflows of $10.0 billion and $1.3 billion from direct hedge fund strategies and hedge fund solutions, respectively. Direct hedge fund strategies includes a variety of single- and multi-strategy offerings. 

In addition, the Company manages $103.9 billion in liquid credit strategies which is included in active fixed income. 

Currency and Commodities

The Company&#8217;s currency and commodities products include a range of active and index products.

Currency and commodities products had $1.6 billion of net inflows, primarily driven by ETFs. ETF commodities products represented $65.6 billion of AUM and are not eligible for performance fees.

Cash Management 

Cash management AUM totaled $755.1 billion at December 31, 2021, reflecting a record $94.0 billion of net inflows. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds, short-term investment funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios are denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, Swiss Francs, New Zealand Dollars or British pounds. Strong growth in cash management reflects BlackRock&#8217;s success in leveraging scale for clients and delivering innovative digital distribution and risk management solutions.

BlackRock is currently voluntarily waiving a portion of its management fees on certain money market funds to ensure that they maintain a minimum level of daily net investment income. During 2021, these waivers resulted in a reduction of management fees of approximately $500 million, which was partially offset by a reduction of BlackRock&#8217;s distribution and servicing costs paid to financial intermediaries. BlackRock has provided voluntary yield support waivers in prior periods and may increase or decrease the level of yield support waivers in future periods. For more information see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.

TECHNOLOGY SERVICES 

&#160;

BlackRock offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools on a fee basis. Aladdin is our proprietary technology platform, providing an end-to-end, SaaS solution for investment and risk management for both BlackRock and a growing number of institutional and retail investors around the world. BlackRock offers risk reporting capabilities via Aladdin Risk, as well as investment accounting capabilities. Aladdin Provider is a tool used by asset servicers, connecting them to the platform used by asset managers and owners to add operational efficiency. In 2020, BlackRock launched Aladdin Climate, a software application offering investors measures of both the physical risk of climate change and the transition risk to a low-carbon economy on portfolios with climate-adjusted security valuations and risk metrics. In 2019, BlackRock acquired eFront, a leading end-to-end alternative investment management software and solutions provider to enable clients to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform. Through our Cachematrix platform, BlackRock is also a leading provider of financial technology which simplifies the cash management process for banks and their corporate clients in a streamlined, open-architecture platform.

&#160;

BlackRock offers a number of wealth management technology tools offering personalized digital advice, portfolio construction capabilities and risk analytics for retail distributors. These tools include Aladdin Wealth, which provides wealth management firms and their financial professionals with institutional-quality business management, portfolio construction, modeling and risk analytics capabilities.

&#160;

Technology services revenue of $1.3 billion was up 12% year-over-year, and annual contract value 1 (&#8220;ACV&#8221;) increased 13% year-over-year. Aladdin assignments are typically long-term contracts that provide recurring revenue. At the end of any period, BlackRock generally has recurring revenue contracts in place for a large portion of total annual revenue. BlackRock measures the fees related to these agreements and refers to this as ACV.

&#160;

At year-end, BlackRock technology services clients included banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, asset servicers, retail distributors and other investors across North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia.

&#160;

Aladdin, which represented the majority of technology services revenue for the year, continues to benefit from trends favoring global platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions across public and private markets. BlackRock is focused on enhancing Aladdin, with continued investment into areas such as whole portfolio, private markets, wealth and a leading sustainable investing solution. Building on eFront&#8217;s industry-leading tools for private asset classes, Aladdin was an early mover to provide data transparency and analytics across public and private assets with over two dozen clients using the capabilities today. To deliver best-in-class sustainability capabilities in Aladdin, including within Aladdin Climate, BlackRock acquired the transition risk models of Baringa through a long term partnership with ongoing innovation and solution development, and the physical risk models of Rhodium, in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively. Additionally, BlackRock made a minority investment in Clarity AI in January 2021 and has integrated these capabilities within Aladdin.

&#160;

BlackRock is also investing to scale Aladdin for its next leg of growth by migrating Aladdin from BlackRock-hosted data centers to the cloud. This will bring enhanced capabilities to BlackRock and its Aladdin clients, accelerating innovation and supporting greater computing scale and flexibility for clients. Through this migration as well as BlackRock&#8217;s partnership with Snowflake, an industry leader in cloud enabled data technology, BlackRock is building Aladdin Data Cloud, a next generation solution that will bring Aladdin and non-Aladdin data together, so clients can nimbly access and use data across their organization, unlocking their full potential for collaboration, creativity, and innovation.

&#160;

In addition, BlackRock has made minority investments in the digital distribution companies Envestnet, Scalable Capital, iCapital, and Acorns. BlackRock records its share of income related to minority investments accounted for under the equity method in other revenue and records gains and losses related to changes in value of other minority investments in nonoperating income (expense).

Securities Lending 

Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. BlackRock receives both cash (primarily for US domiciled portfolios) and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements. The cash management team invests the cash received as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending for US domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings, or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM. 

Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $389 billion, up from $352 billion at year-end 2020. Strong demand for securities resulted in higher balances compared to 2020. On average, relative to 2020, intrinsic lending spreads were higher, while cash reinvestment spreads were lower as cash yields continue to be compressed. Increased demand for specific securities and corporate action lending activity offset the impact of narrower cash reinvestment spreads.

##TABLE_START &#160;

##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START 1 &#160; 

ACV represents forward-looking, annualized estimated value of the recurring subscription fees under client contracts, assuming all client contracts that come up for renewal are renewed, unless we received a notice of termination, even though such notice may not be effective until a later date. ACV also includes the annualized estimated value of new sales, for existing and new clients, when we execute client contracts, even though the recurring fees may not be effective until a later date and excludes nonrecurring fees such as implementation and consulting fees.

##TABLE_END

&#160;

&#160;

BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity and interest rate risk management. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock&#8217;s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived temporarily, such waivers are infrequent. 

Risk &#38; Quantitative Analysis 

Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk &#38; Quantitative Analysis (&#8220;RQA&#8221;) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and enterprise risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

COMPETITION 

BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, investment style and discipline, price, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service. 

HUMAN CAPITAL 

With approximately 18,400 employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients in more than 100 countries across the globe. As an asset manager, BlackRock&#8217;s long-term success depends on its people and how it manages its workforce. 

Culture and Principles

BlackRock believes that developing a strong corporate culture is an important component of its human capital management practices and critical to the firm&#8217;s long-term success. BlackRock&#8217;s culture is underpinned by five core principles that unify its workforce and guide how it interacts with its employees, its clients, the communities in which it operates and all of its other stakeholders: (1) We are a fiduciary to our clients&#59; (2) We are One BlackRock&#59; (3) We are passionate about performance&#59; (4) We take emotional ownership&#59; and (5) We are committed to a better future. 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (&#8220;DEI&#8221;)

BlackRock believes a diverse workforce and an equitable and inclusive work environment are key factors in achieving better outcomes across all levels of its business. BlackRock has made a long-term commitment to cultivating diversity in its workforce and leadership team through its hiring, retention, promotion and development practices. As part of this long-term commitment, BlackRock has instituted a multi-year DEI strategy that it believes is actionable, measurable and designed to apply across the many countries in which the firm operates. The Company has aligned its DEI strategy with the firm&#8217;s business priorities and long-term objectives. BlackRock&#8217;s DEI strategy centers on talent and culture, responding to the needs of our clients, and policy and social impact in the communities in which we operate.

To advance its DEI strategy, BlackRock will strive to:

&#8226; 

Implement leadership development, sponsorship and coaching initiatives to engage and develop underrepresented talent. 

##TABLE_END

Another focus of BlackRock&#8217;s DEI strategy is to cultivate an inclusive, equitable work environment in which employees feel connected to BlackRock&#8217;s culture and supported in pursuit of their professional goals. To this end, BlackRock has committed to raising awareness of racial equity issues and setting high behavioral expectations for employees, as well as to holding firm leaders and managers accountable for continued progress against the firm&#8217;s goals.

BlackRock views transparency and accountability as a critical part of its DEI strategy, including as a means to inform, measure and improve its human capital management practices. To that end, since 2020, the firm has published annual SASB-aligned disclosure, and in 2020, also published for the first time its annual EEO-1 report, both of which include information regarding workforce diversity. During 2020, it also set goals for increasing the overall workplace representation of Black and Latinx employees and growing the number of female and US Black and Latinx leaders at the Director level and above. As of January 1, 2022, of the Company&#8217;s employees who self-identified their gender status, 43.5% of global employees were women. As of January 1, 2022, of the Company&#8217;s US employees who self-identified their race/ethnicity status, 6.9% identified as Black or African American, 6.8% identified as Hispanic/Latinx, 26.0% identified as Asian and 2.5% identified as Native American or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or as &#8220;two or more races&#8221;. 

Board Oversight of Human Capital Management 

BlackRock&#8217;s Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) plays an important role in the oversight of human capital management at BlackRock and devotes one Board meeting annually to an in-depth review of BlackRock&#8217;s culture, talent development, retention and recruiting initiatives, DEI strategy, leadership and succession planning and employee feedback. Moreover, year-end business assessments, which include a review of the progress that is being made against the firm&#8217;s DEI goals, influence individual compensation outcomes that are reviewed and approved by the Board&#8217;s Management Development and Compensation Committee.

Succession planning for BlackRock&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives is a key part of the Board&#8217;s annual review of human capital management issues. As part of this review, the Board focuses on whether BlackRock has the right people in place to execute the Company&#8217;s long-term strategic plans, and on BlackRock&#8217;s ability to identify, attract, develop, promote and retain future senior executives. An important element of the succession planning across the organization is a commitment to building leadership from within and increasing diversity in leadership roles.

&#160;

Employee Engagement 

BlackRock values continuous dialogue with its employees about their experiences at the firm in order to understand employee expectations and assess the efficacy of its human capital management practices. The Company uses several employee engagement mechanisms, including: (i) employee opinion surveys&#59; (ii) interactive townhalls and communications&#59; and (iii) the sponsorship of employee, professional and social impact networks. These employee engagement mechanisms provide BlackRock with actionable feedback for each team and for BlackRock as a whole. BlackRock&#8217;s employee, professional and social impact networks also provide additional forums and opportunities for employees with diverse backgrounds to connect with one another and shape the firm&#8217;s culture. These networks played, and continue to play, an active role in BlackRock&#8217;s response to COVID-19, including by instituting programs to combat isolation and more deeply understand the employee experience during the pandemic. The networks also have served a critical role in the firm&#8217;s dialogue around issues of racial injustice and inequity. The networks, which continue to grow in number, are sponsored by senior leaders and designed by employees, for employees. 

Compensation, Wellness and Benefits 

BlackRock is committed to responsible business practices and believes that investing in the physical, emotional, mental and financial well-being of its employees is a critical component of the firm&#8217;s human capital management strategy. To that end, the Company designs its compensation and benefits practices to: (i) attract, retain and motivate talented employees&#59; (ii) align employee incentives and risk-taking with that of the firm and the interests of its clients&#59; and (iii) support employees across many aspects of their lives. The Company has a strong pay-for-performance culture and an annual compensation process that takes into consideration firmwide results, individual business results and employee performance, as well as market benchmarks. BlackRock also offers a wide range of benefits that it regularly reviews in accordance with leading practices and the local requirements of its offices, including, where applicable, retirement savings plans, a Flexible Time Off (&#8220;FTO&#8221;) policy and flexible working arrangements, and parental leave and family support benefits, including fertility benefits, adoption and surrogacy assistance, and backup elder and childcare benefits. The Company provides comprehensive healthcare and mental-health benefits to eligible employees, including medical, dental and vision coverage, health savings and spending accounts, counseling services, an employee assistance program and access to telemedicine services, where available.

BlackRock prioritizes protecting the rights of its workforce and the equitable treatment of its employees. The Company has implemented policies related to harassment prevention and compliance with equal employment opportunity and overtime regulations. BlackRock is also committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for its workforce. To do this, it designs global programs, including environmental and occupational health and safety programs, to meet or exceed local requirements. Moreover, BlackRock encourages all of its employees to raise issues of concern and assures employees that they may do so without fear of retaliation. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of keeping employees safe and healthy and BlackRock has continued to implement initiatives to support employees. During the pandemic, the Company has prioritized communication about the telemedicine and digital health resources it makes available, including mental, emotional and physical health offerings. For example, the Company created a Mental Health Ambassador program that trained global volunteers across office locations to act as allies for firmwide mental health awareness and direct colleagues to mental health training resources, and the Company rolled out several new benefits to support mental health. BlackRock also launched its Future of Work pilot program to provide employees with flexibility for remote and hybrid work environments in offices across the US and Europe in 2021, and invested in COVID-19 testing, COVID-19 vaccine education and access and other office safety measures. In addition, the Company extended cross-border healthcare coverage and support to employees and their dependents temporarily working, or on FTO, outside of their home country as a result of the pandemic.

Training, Innovation and Development

BlackRock is committed to innovation, learning and reinvention in all areas of its business and believes that developing the capabilities of its employees is integral to delivering long-term value. To that end, the Company&#8217;s human capital management practices are designed to provide opportunities for employees to learn, innovate and enhance their skillsets at every stage of their career. Examples include hosting small group conversations led by external facilitators to help employees build skills necessary to cultivate inclusive environments, and the firm&#8217;s online suite of interactive resources and courses (BlackRock Academies), which enable employees to build skills in specific facets of BlackRock&#8217;s business and purpose. The Company believes these opportunities play an important role in engaging BlackRock&#8217;s employees.

In addition, BlackRock believes that a critical driver of its future growth is its ability to grow strong leaders. The Company is investing in leadership development programs designed to foster career growth. For example, select employees are invited to participate in programs that include executive coaching, in-person and virtual learning and senior management sponsorship.

REGULATION

Virtually all aspects of BlackRock&#8217;s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, and trust and other fiduciary clients of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (&#8220;BTC&#8221;). Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and trust banks and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations or bank charters, censures and fines both for individuals and BlackRock. The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report. 

BlackRock&#8217;s business may be impacted by numerous regulatory reform initiatives occurring around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes to, or in the enforcement of, existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock&#8217;s business activities, lead to business disruptions, require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs) as well as reputational harm. BlackRock&#8217;s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing banking, securities, taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.

&#160;

GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM 

Policymaking workstreams focused on the financial services sector led by global standard setters, such as the Financial Stability Board (&#8220;FSB&#8221;), International Organization of Securities Commissions (&#8220;IOSCO&#8221;) and Bank for International Settlements, may lead to or inform new regulations in multiple jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates. Most recently, such workstreams have focused on areas such as products and activities of non-bank financial institutions, money market funds, open-ended funds (&#8220;OEFs&#8221;), central counterparty margin practices and enhanced ESG disclosures.

Macroprudential Policies for Asset Managers 

Concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector have been heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic and prompted a broad review of existing regulations globally, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural market components in mitigating risks by the FSB, IOSCO, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (&#8220;FSOC&#8221;). The European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) has proposed reforms to increase the availability of liquidity management tools to OEFs, to enhance reporting on the use of liquidity management tools by OEFs to national regulators and to expand the powers of national regulators to require OEF managers to activate liquidity management tools in extreme market conditions. If any of these regulatory or policy actions result in broad application of macroprudential tools to OEFs or require BlackRock to make changes to structural features of certain OEFs, it could limit BlackRock&#8217;s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock.

International Money Market Fund Reforms

Following the market events of March 2020, US, EU and United Kingdom (&#8220;UK&#8221;) authorities initiated a review of existing regulatory frameworks with the aim of improving the resilience of money market funds in market downturns. The review of the EU Money Market Fund Regulation in 2022 could result in significant changes to the rules around liquidity and how some money market funds price shares. The UK may materially depart from the EU approach as they develop their own legal and regulatory framework for money market funds domiciled or marketed in the UK. In the US, the SEC has proposed changes to Rule 2a-7, the primary rule under the Investment Company Act governing money market funds, including changes to required liquidity levels and certain operational aspects of those funds, and changes in pricing under certain circumstances. Such regulatory reforms, if adopted, could significantly and adversely impact certain of BlackRock&#8217;s money market fund products.

ESG and Sustainability Regulations

ESG and sustainability have been the subject of increased regulatory focus across jurisdictions. Globally, the newly created International Sustainability Standards Board and the development of its disclosure standards may inform national regulators&#8217; approaches on these topics. In the US, the SEC has publicly announced that it plans to propose rules to require enhanced disclosure regarding climate change, human capital management and board diversity for public issuers. It has also increased its scrutiny of disclosure and compliance issues relating to investment advisers&#8217; and funds&#8217; ESG strategies. In addition, the US Department of Labor (the &#8220;DoL&#8221;) has proposed regulations that could affect how ESG factors are considered for purposes of investing assets of plans that are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;), and the exercise of voting rights with respect to plan investments.

The EU has introduced regulatory proposals to underpin sustainable investment products&#59; require disclosure of sustainability-related information by market participants, investment products, and issuers&#59; require integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors&#59; and make the advice and financial product distribution process more receptive to end-investor sustainability preferences. The first set of rules initially took effect in March 2021, with secondary rules to come into force over the course of 2022 and 2023. In addition, requirements for asset managers to report against an EU-wide taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities took effect at the start of 2022, with a further phase expected in 2023, and new proposed regulation to enhance sustainability reporting for EU-based corporate issuers is expected to take effect in 2024. Moreover, several European jurisdictions impose additional restrictions around the offer of ESG funds through labelling, disclosure or marketing requirements at both the fund and asset management level. 

In Asia, regulators in Singapore and Hong Kong have introduced requirements for asset managers to integrate climate risk considerations in investment and risk management processes, together with enhanced disclosure and reporting, beginning in 2022. Hong Kong has also issued enhanced rules for ESG funds sold to retail investors and guidelines for pension trustees on ESG risk management and disclosure.

Taxation

BlackRock&#8217;s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. In the US, legislation at both the federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax (&#8220;FTT&#8221;) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the EU, certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the European Commission (&#8220;EC&#8221;) has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock&#8217;s financial results and clients&#8217; performance results. 

The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock&#8217;s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.

LIBOR Transition

The global transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) continues to progress. Tenors of non-USD LIBOR ceased to be published at the end of 2021 while publication of most USD LIBOR settings is expected to continue through June 2023. US federal legislation regarding the transition of certain contracts, for which removing a LIBOR setting is not easily achievable, has yet to be finalized. If such legislation is not enacted, parties to such unremediated contracts, and the markets more generally, face the potential for uncertainty, disputes, litigation and market disruption.

&#160;

Regulation of Exchange-Traded Funds 

As part of a focus on financial stability issues and due to the significant growth of this product class over the last few years, regulators globally are examining the implications of an increased presence of ETFs in the markets, including those related to transparency, liquidity and structural resiliency. BlackRock and other sponsors of ETFs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to BlackRock, or at all. Depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis, or any associated structural reforms, ETF products may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or restrictions, which may require BlackRock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business.

Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives 

Jurisdictions outside the US in which BlackRock operates have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing, more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact BlackRock and the broader markets. For example, various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules impose requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions, requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), reporting transactions to central data repositories, mandating certain documentation standards, requiring the posting and collection of initial and/or variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed and/or over-the-counter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements.

In the US, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to central clearing and trading venue execution requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank"), with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future. In the EU, central clearing and trading venue requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of BlackRock funds and accounts. On March 1, 2017, most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared, including non-deliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions, became subject to requirements in the US, EU and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect mark-to-market margin payments. For certain BlackRock funds and accounts, initial margin requirements may apply in the future in addition to such mark-to-market margin payments. These rules and regulations have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for BlackRock's clients, and may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase BlackRock&#8217;s operational and legal risks.

US REGULATORY REFORM

Federal Trade Commission Proposal 

In September 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing certain changes to premerger notification rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (&#8220;HSR&#8221;) that require parties to certain transactions to provide the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would: (i) require that investors aggregate holdings in an issuer across all associated funds when assessing HSR filing and exemption thresholds and (ii) create a new exemption for acquisitions resulting in aggregate holdings of up to 10% of an issuer, which exemption would be unavailable to investors holding interests of more than 1% in competing firms. If enacted as drafted, the proposal requiring aggregation across associated funds could, absent exemptions for index funds or certain types of registered funds, substantially increase BlackRock&#8217;s pre-merger notification obligations, which may be costly, impair funds&#8217; ability to trade freely creating significant tracking error and cash drag for index funds and opportunity costs for actively managed funds, require the implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both BlackRock and the companies in which it invests. In instances where filing a pre-merger notification may not be practicable, the proposed changes may serve to limit the size of BlackRock&#8217;s aggregate position in certain issuers if BlackRock is unable to satisfy the revised regulatory requirements.

SEC Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers

The SEC and its staff have engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies. These efforts relate to, among other things, embedded leverage through the use of derivatives and other trading practices, cybersecurity, liquidity, enhanced regulatory and public reporting requirements and the evaluation of systemic risks. The SEC has adopted rules that include among other things: (i) the regulation of the use of derivatives, (ii) a new regulatory framework for fund of funds structures and (iii) an updated regulatory framework for fund valuation practices.

Systemically Important Financial Institution (&#8220;SIFI&#8221;) Review 

The &#160; FSOC has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the United States under Dodd-Frank. In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from its previous entity-specific approach to designation and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management, which was re-affirmed in December 2019 with its change in methodology for assessing financial stability to a products and activities-based approach. However, the FSOC retains the authority to designate an entity if an activities-based approach does not adequately address potential risks. If BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve.

Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act

The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (&#8220;HFCAA&#8221;) was enacted in December 2020 and requires the SEC to identify issuers that use a registered public accounting firm to issue an audit report where the firm is located in a foreign jurisdiction that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (&#8220;PCAOB&#8221;) has determined it is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a position taken by an authority in the foreign jurisdiction. The PCAOB and SEC have recently finalized their respective rules to implement the HFCAA, which could subject certain foreign issuers&#8217; securities to trading prohibitions in US markets and subsequent delisting from US exchanges as early as 2024. As a result, certain BlackRock products may be impacted and BlackRock may be subject to additional regulatory, compliance and disclosure requirements, which may be costly.

&#160;

Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives 

The SEC, Federal Reserve, the Internal Revenue Service and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;) each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts. If adopted, any such limitations or restrictions could require BlackRock to change certain business practices or implement new compliance processes, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions. 

In October 2020, the SEC adopted new regulations governing the use of derivatives by registered investment companies (&#8220;RICs&#8221;), including mutual funds (other than money market funds), ETFs and closed-end funds, as well as business development companies. RICs will be required to implement and comply with the new rule by the third quarter of 2022. Once implemented, the rule will, among other things, impose limits on the amount of derivatives transactions a RIC can enter into, eliminate the current asset segregation compliance framework and introduce new compliance requirements for funds, including the establishment of comprehensive risk management programs. The rule may impact certain RICs&#8217; usage of derivatives and investment strategy. 

On December 15, 2021, the SEC proposed rules in connection with security-based swaps (&#8220;SBS&#8221;) transactions, to prevent undue influence over Chief Compliance Officers of SBS dealers and major market participants and to require reporting of large SBS positions. These rules, if adopted as proposed, may affect the types of transactions BlackRock may choose to execute in SBS or other SBS-related assets, introduce or increase costs relating to such transactions, impact the liquidity in the SBS markets in which BlackRock transacts, and increase BlackRock&#8217;s regulatory compliance and disclosure requirements.

SEC Proposed Rules on Private Fund Advisers

The SEC has recently proposed new rules and amendments to enhance regulation of private fund advisors. These include proposed amendments to Form PF for SEC-registered investment advisers that add new required disclosures to the form, require advisers to file reports within one business day for certain significant events, lower the threshold for large private equity adviser reporting and impose increased reporting obligations on large liquidity fund advisers. The SEC has also proposed additional rules that would, among other things, require registered private fund advisers to (i) provide quarterly reports to investors of fund performance, fees and expenses, (ii) obtain an annual audit for each fund and (iii) distribute to investors a fairness opinion and summary of certain material business relationships with the opinion provider in connection with an adviser-led secondary transaction. In addition, the proposed rules would prohibit private fund advisers from engaging in certain activities and practices deemed to be contrary to the public interest and investor protection, providing certain types of preferential terms for selected investors and providing any other preferential treatment unless disclosed to current and prospective investors. These rules and amendments, if adopted as proposed, could significantly increase BlackRock&#8217;s reporting, disclosure and compliance obligations and create operational complexity for BlackRock&#8217;s alternatives products.

SEC Rule 15c2-11

SEC Rule 15c2-11 governs the submission of quotes into quotation systems by broker-dealers and has historically been applied to the over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) equity markets. However, the SEC recently stated that it intends to apply the rule to fixed income markets. The SEC staff also issued no-action relief in December 2021 setting out a phased implementation period for applying the rule to segments of the fixed income markets. While material impacts are not expected in Phase 1 of the implementation, Phase 2 may disrupt primary and secondary market liquidity, which could adversely impact BlackRock&#8217;s business activities. 

Proposed Rules on Regulation ATS

In January 2022, the SEC proposed amendments to Regulation ATS. The proposed rules would expand the types of systems that could fall within the definition of &#8220;exchange&#8221; and extend Regulation ATS and Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity to systems involving US government securities trading. If enacted as proposed, these rules could impact certain functionality and tools offered by Aladdin and require ATS registration, which may increase compliance costs for BlackRock.

Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Proposed Rulemaking for Registered Investment Advisers

In 2015, the Financial Crime Enforcement Network (&#8220;FinCEN&#8221;) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (&#8220;Proposed Rule&#8221;) that would extend to a number of BlackRock&#8217;s subsidiaries, which are registered or required to be registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Advisers Act, the requirement to establish written risk-based anti-money laundering programs and report suspicious activity to FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (the &#8220;Bank Secrecy Act&#8221;). The Proposed Rule would include investment advisers within the Bank Secrecy Act&#8217;s definition of &#8220;financial institutions&#8221;, which would require them to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act reporting and recordkeeping requirements. If adopted in its current form, the Proposed Rule would expose BlackRock to additional compliance costs.

INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY REFORM

EU Market Access and Outsourcing 

In November 2021, the EU formally published legislative proposals amending both the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (&#8220;AIFMD&#8221;) and Directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (&#8220;UCITS&#8221;) fund frameworks. The proposed changes remain broadly consistent with the current regulatory framework but with increased notification requirements to national regulators and the European Securities and Markets Authority (&#8220;ESMA&#8221;), enhanced liquidity management requirements and new requirements for loan originating funds. There is a proposal that would require notification for instances of significant delegation of portfolio management or risk management functions to entities located outside the EU. ESMA would then be required to present market analysis and supervisory peer review every two years to the European Parliament. These proposals and any further regulatory actions could impact delegated activities, increase compliance costs and impact products and services offered to EU clients.

Revised Capital Requirements for Investment Firms 

In June 2021, the Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements for investment firms in scope of the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive for investment firms proposed by the European Commission (the &#8220;EC&#8221;) came into effect, resulting in changes to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements in the EU, changes to the method of calculating such capital and liquidity, and revised disclosure obligations for large investment firms. The UK has also adopted comparable rules, which have applied to UK-based investment firms from January 2022. Changes 

&#160;

to the supervisory approach to assessing the risk of harm posed by BlackRock&#8217;s operations or asset management activities more broadly could increase the amount of regulatory capital and liquidity required to be held in the future , and the new rules impose other prudential requirements . 

Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms

The EU&#8217;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (&#8220;DORA&#8221;), proposed by the EC in September 2020 and currently going through the EU's ordinary legislative procedure, focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services. If enacted as proposed, DORA may, among other things: (i) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, testing and information sharing requirements to several of BlackRock&#8217;s European entities and certain Aladdin clients&#59; and (ii) subject Aladdin &#160; to broad additional oversight. Separately, in November 2020, the FSB released a Consultation on Regulatory and Supervisory Issues Relating to Outsourcing and Third-Party Relationships, which explores direct supervision of technology service providers to financial services firms, in addition to detailing concerns around the potential for systemic risk in the provision of such services.

Central Securities Depository Regulation 

Aspects of the settlement discipline regime introduced by the Central Securities Depository Regulation came into effect on February 1, 2022. These include rules for trade allocation and confirmation processing, along with cash penalties for failed transactions. However, the mandatory buy-in regime was delayed. Implementation of the regime required new operational mechanisms to facilitate compliance, which may increase resources and cost.

UK Divergence Reforms &#160; 

Several UK regimes are currently subject to regulatory changes as the UK diverges from on-shored EU rules following the UK&#8217;s exit from the EU, including the Wholesale Markets Regime on the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Markets in Financial Instruments frameworks, which is open to public consultation through 2022, and the regime for non-UK-based funds that are recognized for sale into the UK, which is currently under government review. The introduction and implementation of any proposed changes to these regimes may lead to additional expenses and operational complexity and may impact products available to UK investors.

UK Conduct Regime

The Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) continues to focus on conduct regulation, including the application of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime (&#8220;SMCR&#8221;) and a new Consumer Duty to all asset management firms, including BlackRock&#8217;s UK subsidiaries. The SMCR imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of UK financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence. SMCR impacts nearly all Company staff in the UK and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities. The new Consumer Duty enhances duties on firms to take end-consumer duty interests into account when designing and managing retail products or services. Any failure to meet the FCA&#8217;s regulatory expectations could expose BlackRock and its senior managers to regulatory sanctions and increased reputational risk, which could in turn adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business in the UK.

Reform of Investment Markets

BlackRock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives that may affect the Company&#8217;s provision of investment services globally. In Europe, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&#8220;MiFID&#8221;) governing the provision of investment services has been revised and is accompanied by an associated Regulation (together with certain secondary regulation, &#8220;MiFID II&#8221;). The Regulation&#8217;s requirements generally apply consistently across the EU. The MiFID II reforms, which came into force in January 2018, were substantive, materially changing market transparency requirements, enhancing protections afforded to investors, and increasing operational complexity for the Company. Forthcoming proposals to review the operation of MiFID II and to develop a new EU Retail Investment Strategy may affect the European market structure and impact BlackRock&#8217;s ability to operate in European markets. The broad nature of the MiFID II means future reforms could also affect product development, client servicing and distribution models. Similar reforms have been implemented in Switzerland and Australia.

Regulatory Environment in China 

The Company&#8217;s operations in China are subject to a number of regulatory risks, including an evolving regulatory environment and complex data security and data transfer regulations. These factors may increase compliance risk and costs, limit the Company&#8217;s ability to source and execute new investment opportunities and lead to impairment losses on its investments. Restrictions on the transfer of the Company&#8217;s Chinese onshore data to offshore entities also may limit BlackRock&#8217;s ability to aggregate, report and monitor such data on its global platform. In addition, a number of regulators in China have jurisdiction over BlackRock&#8217;s business operations, increasing operational and regulatory engagement complexity. These risks may be further heightened by additional scrutiny by Chinese regulators of certain sectors, such as technology and other industries that might be deemed to be of national importance.

E XISTING US REGULATION - OVERVIEW 

BlackRock and certain of its US subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the DoL, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), the National Futures Association (&#8220;NFA&#8221;), the FTC, the Department of Justice, the CFTC and other federal government agencies and regulatory bodies. 

Certain of BlackRock&#8217;s US subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies. In addition, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the &#8220;Advisers Act&#8221;) imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. State level regulation through attorneys general, insurance commissioners and other state level agencies also applies to certain BlackRock activities.

The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;) imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock and its affiliates. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser&#8217;s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities 

&#160;

laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage. 

BlackRock&#8217;s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), as well as the rules of various securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, as well as restrictions on BlackRock&#8217;s activities and damage to its reputation. Furthermore, Dodd-Frank requires one of BlackRock&#8217;s subsidiaries, BTC, to register as a municipal advisor (as that term is defined in the Exchange Act) with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (&#8220;MSRB&#8221;). BTC's registration as a municipal advisor subjects BTC to additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB.

BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, real estate funds, collective trust funds, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rulemaking or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators in this area. 

Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to ERISA, and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DoL, insofar as they act as a &#8220;fiduciary&#8221; under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients that are subject to ERISA. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require certain BlackRock entities to carry bonds insuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to clients that are not subject to ERISA. 

BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators and/or commodity trading advisors with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of Dodd-Frank, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. In addition, two of BlackRock&#8217;s subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer&#8217;s permitted activities. One of the broker-dealers is also a member of the MSRB and is subject to MSRB rules.

BlackRock&#8217;s business activity in California that involves the processing of personal information is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which provides for enhanced consumer protections for California residents. The CCPA imposes obligations on BlackRock for the handling, disclosure and deletion of personal information for California residents. Any failure by BlackRock to comply with the CCPA may result in fines, heightened regulatory scrutiny, litigation and/or reputational harm. 

US Banking Regulation 

One of BlackRock&#8217;s subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a nationally-chartered limited purpose trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as laws and regulations governing capital adequacy, fiduciary activities, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and the prevention of financial crime, including money laundering. BTC is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC and/or BTC&#8217;s customers rather than BlackRock, its affiliates or stockholders.

US Regulation of Securities Financing Transactions

In its 2014 Annual Report, FSOC identified securities lending indemnification by asset managers who act as lending agents as a potential systemic risk that required further review and monitoring. The Federal Reserve is also considering whether to impose specific margin or minimum haircut requirements for securities financing transactions.

EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION &#8212; OVERVIEW 

BlackRock&#8217;s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, these operations are also affected by US laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application. 

Below is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock&#8217;s subsidiaries conduct business. 

Of note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and complex regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. 

European Regulation 

The FCA currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the UK. It is also responsible for the conduct of business regulation of the UK branches of one of BlackRock&#8217;s US subsidiaries. In addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority (&#8220;PRA&#8221;) regulates one BlackRock UK insurance subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and (where relevant) the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services-related business in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the &#8220;FSMA&#8221;). The FCA&#8217;s rules adopted under the FSMA govern the majority of a firm&#8217;s capital and liquidity resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business requirements, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to BlackRock&#8217;s UK-based insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises BlackRock&#8217;s UK-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and thematic reviews in order to monitor BlackRock&#8217;s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA&#8217;s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against BlackRock&#8217;s UK-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees.

&#160;

In addition, BlackRock has regulated entities in France, Germany, Ireland, Jersey, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Each of these entities is required to comply with regulatory rules in the country in which it has been established, including the branches of the Netherlands entity which operate across the EU. 

BlackRock&#8217;s EU subsidiaries and branches must comply with the EU regulatory regime set out in MiFID II. BlackRock&#8217;s UK-regulated subsidiaries must comply with the UK version of MiFID II, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities in the UK. MiFID II, and the UK equivalent of MiFID II, sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. The legislation also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock UK subsidiaries must also comply with the UK regulation which implements the Consolidated Life Directive and Insurance Distribution Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for certain investment firms. These include requirements to ensure capital adequacy, as well as matters of governance and remuneration. Relevant BlackRock entities must also comply with the requirements of the UCITS Directive and the AIFMD, as implemented in the relevant EU Member States and in the UK, which impose obligations on the authorization and capital, conduct of business, organization, transparency and marketing of retail and alternative investment funds respectively that are sold in, or marketed to, the EU. The obligations introduced through these regulations and directives will affect certain of BlackRock&#8217;s European operations. Compliance with the UCITS Directives and the AIFMD may subject BlackRock to additional expenses associated with depositary oversight and other organizational requirements. 

BlackRock&#8217;s EU-regulated subsidiaries are also subject to Regulation 2012648/EU ("EMIR") (or the UK version of EMIR transposed into UK law in accordance with The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in the case of BlackRock&#8217;s UK-regulated subsidiaries), an EU regulation governing derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which requires (i) the central clearing of certain OTC derivatives&#59; (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives (including the exchange of collateral with certain counterparties)&#59; and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts to an ESMA registered or recognized derivatives trade repository (or a UK authorized trade repository in the case of the UK version of EMIR) . 

The EU has seen an increase in Common Supervisory Actions by ESMA to coordinate supervisory action by national EU regulators, most notably in areas such as product governance, liquidity management and fund costs and charges. BlackRock&#8217;s EU operations may be affected to the extent this initiative results in formal legislation or action. 

EU Member States, the UK and many other non-US jurisdictions have adopted statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection and requiring notification of personal data security breaches if certain thresholds are met. For example, in May 2018, the EU Data Protection Directive was replaced by a more extensive General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;). In addition, the UK transposed the GDPR into national law (&#8220;UK GDPR&#8221;). In July 2020, the EU-US Privacy Shield was invalidated as a valid personal data transfer mechanism and in June 2021, the EC published a new set of standard contractual clauses, which only apply to the transfer of personal data outside of the EU to a country not approved by the EU as providing an adequate level of protection for the processing of personal data. The EU's adequacy decision with respect to the UK, which allows the continued flow of personal data from the EU to the UK, will be regularly reviewed and may be revoked if the UK diverges from its current adequate data protection laws. The UK has developed its own international data transfer agreement set to be implemented in March 2022. GDPR and UK GDPR, as well as other statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection, increase compliance obligations, affect BlackRock&#8217;s collection, processing, retention and transfer of personal data and reporting of personal data security breaches, and provide for increased penalties for non-compliance.

Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region 

In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (&#8220;FIEA&#8221;) and the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (&#8220;JFSA&#8221;), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEA. This Japanese subsidiary also holds a license for real estate brokerage activities which subjects it to the regulations set forth in the Real Estate Brokerage Act. 

In Australia, BlackRock&#8217;s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws, and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (&#8220;ASIC&#8221;). ASIC regulates companies and financial services activities in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. 

The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (&#8220;SFO&#8221;), which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (&#8220;SFC&#8221;). The SFC is also empowered to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC. 

BlackRock&#8217;s operations in Taiwan are regulated by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for regulating securities markets (including the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Taiwan Futures Exchange), the banking industry and the insurance sector. 

BlackRock&#8217;s Fund Management Company in China (&#8220;BlackRock FMC&#8221;) is regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and is subject to the Securities Investment Fund Law for the overall oversight from incorporation to the corporate governance and operations of fund managers and funds. BlackRock FMC is also subject to the China Securities Law and various other financial laws and regulations. BlackRock&#8217;s Wealth Management Joint Venture Company with Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd and China Construction Bank Corp in China, BlackRock CCB Wealth Management Limited, is regulated by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (&#8220;CBIRC&#8221;). CBIRC have enacted Bank Wealth Management Supervision and Management Measures and Management Measures of Bank Wealth Management Subsidiaries since 2018 to regulate the setup, conduct of business and risk management of bank wealth management companies.

&#160;

Other financial regulators oversee BlackRock subsidiaries, branches and representative offices across the Asia-Pacific region, including in Singapore and South Korea. Regulators in all of these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant, suspend or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements.
