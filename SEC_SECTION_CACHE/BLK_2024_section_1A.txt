 Item 1A. Risk Factors 

As a global investment management firm, risk is an inherent part of BlackRock&#8217;s business. Global markets, by their nature, are prone to uncertainty and subject participants to a variety of risks. While BlackRock devotes significant resources across all of its operations to identify, measure, monitor, manage and analyze market, operating, legal, compliance, reputational, fiduciary and investment risks, BlackRock&#8217;s business, financial condition, operating results and nonoperating results could be materially adversely affected and the Company&#8217;s stock price could decline as a result of any of these risks and uncertainties, including the ones discussed below. 

MARKET AND COMPETITION RISKS 

Changes in the value levels of equity, debt, real assets, commodities, foreign exchange or other asset markets, as well as the impact of global trade policies and tariffs, may cause assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;), revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock&#8217;s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees based on a percentage of the value of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees which are normally expressed as a percentage of returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or movements in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments in which BlackRock invests on behalf of its clients, as well as the impact of global fiscal, monetary and trade policies, could cause: 

&#8226; the value of AUM, or BlackRock's returns on AUM, to decrease; 

&#8226; client redemptions from BlackRock&#8217;s products; 

&#8226; client rebalancing or reallocating of assets into BlackRock products that yield lower fees; 

&#8226; an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or 

&#8226; a decrease in the value of seed or co-investment capital. 

These risks may also be heightened by market volatility, illiquid market conditions or other market disruptions. The occurrence of any of the above events may cause the Company&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Changes in interest or foreign exchange rates and/or divergent beta may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM and base fees to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company&#8217;s net income and operating cash flows. 

In recent years, global markets have experienced substantial volatility, with significant downturns in both bond and equity markets. In addition, central banks worldwide have raised interest rates in an effort to moderate rising inflation. BlackRock&#8217;s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates. Similarly, due to the global nature of BlackRock&#8217;s operations, a portion of its business is conducted in currencies other than the United States ("US") dollar. BlackRock&#8217;s exposure to foreign exchange rates relative to the US dollar and interest rates may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company&#8217;s base fees, net income and operating cash flows. 

In addition, beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUM weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock&#8217;s effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AUM and base fees. 

BlackRock&#8217;s investment advisory contracts may be terminated or may not be renewed by clients and fund boards on favorable terms and the liquidation of certain funds may be accelerated at the option of investors. 

BlackRock derives a substantial portion of its revenue from providing investment advisory services. The advisory or management contracts BlackRock has entered into with its clients, including the agreements that govern many of BlackRock&#8217;s investment funds, provide investors or, in some cases, the independent directors of applicable investment funds, with significant latitude to terminate such contracts, withdraw funds or liquidate funds, or to remove BlackRock as a fund&#8217;s investment advisor (or equivalent). BlackRock also manages its US mutual funds, closed-end and exchange-traded funds under management contracts that must be renewed and approved annually by the funds&#8217; respective boards of directors, a majority of whom are independent from the Company. BlackRock&#8217;s fee arrangements under any of its advisory or management contracts may be reduced (including at the behest of a fund&#8217;s board of directors). In addition, shareholder activism involving closed-end funds has increased, including public campaigns to demand that a fund consider significant transactions such as a tender offer, merger or liquidation or seek other actions such as the termination of the fund's management contract. If a number of BlackRock&#8217;s clients terminate their contracts, or otherwise remove BlackRock from its advisory roles, liquidate funds or fail to renew management contracts on similar terms, the fees or carried interest BlackRock earns could be reduced, which may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

The failure or negative performance of products offered by competitors may cause AUM in similar BlackRock products to decline irrespective of BlackRock&#8217;s performance. 

Many competitors offer similar products to those offered by BlackRock and the failure or negative performance of competitors&#8217; products could lead to a loss of confidence in similar BlackRock products, irrespective of the performance of such BlackRock products. Any loss of confidence in a product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products, which may cause the Company&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Increased competition may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

The investment management industry is highly competitive, and BlackRock competes based on a number of factors including: investment performance, liquidity, its technology and portfolio construction offerings, the level of fees charged, the quality and breadth of services and products provided, name recognition and reputation, and its ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors. In addition, over the past several years, there has been continued consolidation in the asset management industry as investors increasingly seek out firms that have the capacity to deliver broad multi-asset investment capabilities and technological expertise, including in a manner that is responsive to ever more localized needs. This consolidation, together with the introduction of new technologies, as well as regulatory changes, continues to alter the competitive landscape for investment managers, which may lead to additional fee compression or require BlackRock to invest more to modify or adapt its product offerings to attract and retain customers and remain competitive with the products, services and geographic diversity offered by other financial institutions, technology companies, trading, advisory or asset management firms. Increased competition on the basis of any of these factors, including competition leading to fee reductions on existing or new business, may cause the Company&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

&#160; 

Failure to maintain Aladdin&#8217;s competitive position in a dynamic market could lead to a loss of clients and could impede BlackRock&#8217;s productivity and growth. 

The sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio management, trade execution and investment operations that BlackRock provides via its technology platform to support investment advisory and Aladdin clients are important elements of BlackRock&#8217;s competitive success. Aladdin&#8217;s competitive position is based in part on its ability to combine risk analytics with portfolio management, trading and operations tools on a single platform. Increased competition from risk analytics and investment management technology providers, including as a result of growing industry consolidation giving rise to competitors with increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive product offerings, or a shift in client demand toward standalone or internally developed solutions, whether due to price competition, perceived client market share, platform offerings or flexibility, or market-based or regulatory factors, may weaken Aladdin&#8217;s competitive position and may cause the Company&#8217;s revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, to the extent that Aladdin competitors are able to innovate more effectively than BlackRock or leverage delivery models that provide clients faster time to market, lower costs or the ability to more seamlessly combine or bundle with other service offerings, BlackRock may lose existing clients or fail to capture future market share, which may impede its productivity and growth. Moreover, although BlackRock takes steps to safeguard against infringements of its intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;), there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to effectively protect and enforce its IP rights in Aladdin. 

BlackRock may be unable to develop new products and services and the development of new products and services may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, additional costs or operational risk . 

BlackRock&#8217;s financial performance depends, in part, on its ability to react to changes in the asset management industry, respond to evolving client demands and develop, market and manage new investment products and services. The development and introduction of new products and services, including the creation of increasingly customizable products, requires continued innovative effort on the part of BlackRock and may require significant time and resources as well as ongoing support and investment. Substantial risk and uncertainties are associated with the introduction of new products and services, including the implementation of new and appropriate operational controls and procedures, shifting client and market preferences, the introduction of competing products or services, constraints on BlackRock&#8217;s ability to manage growth within client mandates, compliance with regulatory and disclosure requirements and IP-related lawsuits or claims, which may not be fully evident or identified at such time. A growing number of BlackRock&#8217;s products and services also depend on data provided by third parties as analytical inputs and are subject to additional risks, including with respect to data quality, cost, availability and provider relationships. Data sets for certain developing analytics, such as those in the sustainability space, continue to evolve and difficulties approximating gaps in the data, sourcing data from reliable sources, or validating the data could adversely impact the accuracy and effectiveness of such analytics. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to innovate effectively in order to develop new products or services that address the needs of its clients on the timeline they require. Any failure to successfully develop new products and services, or effectively manage associated operational risks, could harm BlackRock&#8217;s reputation and expose the Company to additional costs, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Changes in the value of seed and co-investments that BlackRock owns as well as BlackRock&#8217;s minority investments could affect its income and could increase the volatility of its earnings. 

At December 31, 2023, BlackRock&#8217;s net economic investment exposure of approximately $3.8 billion in its investments (see Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments ) primarily resulted from co-investments and seed investments in its sponsored investment funds. Movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or other alternative investments, could lower the value of these investments as well as certain minority investments, increase the volatility of BlackRock&#8217;s earnings and cause earnings to decline. 

BlackRock indemnifies certain securities lending clients for specified losses as a result of a borrower default. 

BlackRock provides borrower default indemnification to certain of its securities lending clients. In the event of a borrower default, BlackRock would use the collateral pledged by the borrower to repurchase securities out on loan in order to replace them in a client&#8217;s account. Borrower default indemnification is limited to the shortfall that occurs in the event the collateral available at the time of the borrower&#8217;s default is insufficient to repurchase those securities out on loan. BlackRock requires all borrowers to mark to market their pledged collateral daily to levels in excess of the value of the securities out on loan which mitigates the likelihood of the indemnity being triggered. Where the collateral is in the form of cash, the indemnities BlackRock provides do not guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the investment performance or return of any cash collateral vehicle into which that cash collateral is invested. The amount of securities on loan as of December 31, 2023 and subject to this type of indemnification was approximately $259 billion. In the Company&#8217;s capacity as lending agent, cash and securities totaling approximately $276 billion was held as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at December 31, 2023. Significant borrower defaults occurring simultaneously with rapid declines in the value of collateral pledged and/or increases in the value of the securities loaned may create collateral shortfalls, which could result in material liabilities under these indemnities and may cause the Company&#8217;s revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock&#8217;s decision on whether to provide support to particular products from time to time, or the inability to provide support, may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

While not legally mandated, BlackRock may, at its option, from time to time choose to seed, warehouse or otherwise support investment products through capital or credit support for commercial or other reasons. Any decision by BlackRock on whether to support products may utilize capital and liquidity that would otherwise be available for other corporate purposes. BlackRock&#8217;s ability to seed, warehouse or otherwise support certain products may be restricted by regulation or by the Company&#8217;s failure to have or make available sufficient capital or liquidity. Moreover, inherent constraints arising from the business models of certain asset managers, including BlackRock, may during periods of market volatility result in BlackRock having fewer options for accessing liquidity than asset managers with alternate business models, which may adversely impact its ability to support certain products. Any decision by BlackRock to support particular products, or its inability or unwillingness to provide such support, may result in losses or affect BlackRock's capital or liquidity, which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

&#160; 

Geopolitical unrest and other events outside of BlackRock&#8217;s control could adversely affect the global economy or specific international, regional and domestic markets, which may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Geopolitical risks, including those arising from trade tension and/or the imposition of trade tariffs, terrorist activity or acts of civil or international hostility, could have an adverse impact on BlackRock. For instance, the Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas wars and potential escalation have and may continue to result in geopolitical instability and adversely affect the global economy, supply chains, specific markets and operations. Strategic competition between the US and China and resulting tensions and heightened levels of political polarization have also contributed to uncertainty in the geopolitical and regulatory landscapes. Similarly, other events outside of BlackRock&#8217;s control, including natural disasters, climate-related events, pandemics or health crises may arise from time to time and be accompanied by governmental actions that may increase international tension or impact the US or global economy in ways that are uncertain. Any such events and responses, including regulatory developments, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, disproportionate impacts to certain industries or sectors, disruptions to commerce (including to economic activity, travel and supply chains), loss of life and property damage, and may adversely affect the global economy or capital markets, as well as the Company&#8217;s products, operations, clients, vendors and employees, which may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. BlackRock&#8217;s exposure to geopolitical risks may be heightened to the extent such risks arise in countries in which BlackRock currently operates or seeks to expand its presence. 

Climate-related risks could adversely affect BlackRock&#8217;s business, products, operations and clients, which may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock&#8217;s business and those of its clients could be impacted by climate-related risks. Climate-related risks may impact BlackRock through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Climate-related physical risks arise from the direct impacts of a changing climate in the short- and long-term. Such risks may include the risks of extreme weather events and changes in temperature, which may damage infrastructure and facilities, including BlackRock&#8217;s physical assets, as well as disrupt connectivity or supply chains. Climate-related transition risks arise from exposure to the transition to a low-carbon economy through policy, regulatory, technology and market changes. For instance, new or divergent climate regulations or guidance, as well as differing perspectives of stakeholders regarding climate impacts, have affected and may continue to affect BlackRock&#8217;s business activities and reputation, increase scrutiny and complicate compliance requirements, which could increase the Company&#8217;s costs. 

Climate-related physical and transition risks could also impact BlackRock&#8217;s business both directly and indirectly through adverse impacts to its clients&#8217; investments, including as a result of declines in asset values, changes in client preferences, increased regulatory and compliance costs and significant business disruptions. Any of these risks may cause the Company&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

RISKS RELATED TO INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE 

Poor investment performance could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

The Company&#8217;s management believes that investment performance, including the efficient delivery of beta, is one of the most important factors for the growth and retention of AUM. Poor investment performance relative to applicable portfolio benchmarks, aggregate fee levels or competitors may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline as a result of: 

&#8226; client withdrawals in favor of better performing products offered by competitors; 

&#8226; client shifts to products that charge lower fees; 

&#8226; the diminishing ability to attract additional funds from existing and new clients; 

&#8226; reduced, minimal or no performance fees; 

&#8226; an impairment to the value of intangible assets and goodwill; or 

&#8226; a decrease in the valuations of seed and co-investment capital. 

Performance fees may increase volatility of both revenue and earnings. 

A portion of BlackRock&#8217;s revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory assignments. Performance fees represented $554 million, or 3%, of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Generally, the Company is entitled to a performance fee only if the agreement under which it is managing the assets provides for one and if returns on the related portfolio exceed agreed-upon periodic or cumulative return targets. If these targets are not exceeded, a performance fee for that period will not be earned and, if targets are based on cumulative returns, the Company may not earn performance fees in future periods. The volatility of the Company&#8217;s future revenue and earnings may also be affected due to illiquid alternatives becoming an increasing component of the overall composition of the Company&#8217;s performance fee generating assets. In particular, the Company expects that as it manages more illiquid products, its performance fees will generally be recognized over substantially longer multi-year periods than those associated with more liquid products. 

Failure to identify errors in the quantitative models BlackRock utilizes to manage its business could adversely affect product performance and client relationships. 

BlackRock employs various quantitative models to support its investment processes, including those related to risk assessment, portfolio management, trading and hedging activities and product valuations. Any errors or limitations in the underlying models, model inputs or assumptions, including those from third-party sources, as well as any failure of BlackRock&#8217;s governance, approval, testing and validation standards in respect of such models, model inputs or assumptions, the failure to timely update such models, model inputs or assumptions or errors in how such models are used, could have adverse effects on BlackRock&#8217;s business and reputation. These risks may be heightened by the rapid growth and complexity of new models, evolving data sets and standards and market volatility. 

&#160; 

TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATIONAL RISKS 

A failure in, or disruption to, BlackRock&#8217;s operations, systems or infrastructure, including business continuity plans, could adversely affect operations, damage the Company&#8217;s reputation and cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock&#8217;s infrastructure, including its technological capacity, data centers and office space, is vital to the competitiveness of its business. Moreover, a significant portion of BlackRock&#8217;s critical business operations is concentrated in a limited number of geographic areas, including San Francisco, New York, London, Edinburgh, Budapest, Atlanta, Gurgaon and Belgrade. The failure to maintain an infrastructure commensurate with the size and scope of BlackRock&#8217;s business, or the occurrence of a business outage or event outside BlackRock&#8217;s control, including a major earthquake, hurricane, fire, terrorist act, pandemic, health crisis or other catastrophic event, or the actions of individuals or groups seeking to disrupt BlackRock&#8217;s operations in any location at which BlackRock maintains a major presence, could materially impact operations, result in business disruption or impede the Company's growth. 

Despite BlackRock&#8217;s efforts to ensure business continuity, if it fails to keep business continuity plans up-to-date or if such plans, including secure back-up facilities and systems and the availability of back-up employees, are improperly implemented or deployed during a disruption, the Company&#8217;s ability to operate could be adversely impacted which may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline or impact the Company&#8217;s ability to comply with regulatory obligations or contractual obligations leading to reputational harm, legal liability, regulatory fines and/or sanctions. 

A cyber-attack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and lead to financial losses and reputational harm, which may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock is dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities it maintains to protect its computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them, including data provided by third parties that is significant to portions of BlackRock's business and products. An information security incident or disruption, such as a cyber-attack including social engineering, a phishing scam, business email compromise, malware, denial-of-service or ransomware attack, or a failure to control access to sensitive systems, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information. Moreover, developments in BlackRock&#8217;s use of process automation and artificial intelligence (&#8220;AI&#8221;), as well as the use of remote access by employees and mobile and cloud technologies, could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex, unpredictable or beyond BlackRock&#8217;s control. BlackRock&#8217;s growing exposure to the public Internet, as well as reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks, could disrupt BlackRock&#8217;s operations and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information or third-party data. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies including quantum computing increase the speed and computing power available. 

The financial services industry has been the subject of cyber-attacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information or other assets, as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties, including nation state actors, terrorist organizations, cyber criminals and hacktivists. BlackRock has been and continues to be the target of cyber-attacks, as well as the co-opting of its brand, and continues to monitor and develop its systems to protect its technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption, as the failure to do so could disrupt BlackRock&#8217;s operations and cause financial losses. Advances in technology, including generative AI, and use of such technology by malicious actors could heighten these risks. Although BlackRock has implemented policies and controls, and takes protective measures involving significant expense, to prevent and address potential data breaches, inadvertent disclosures, increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks and cyber-related fraud, there can be no assurance that any of these measures proves fully effective. In addition, given the evolving nature of cyber threat actors and the increasing sophistication of cyber-attack methodology, a successful cyber-attack may persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and it may take a considerable amount of time for an investigation to be completed and the severity and potential impact to be known. Moreover, due to the complexity and interconnectedness of BlackRock&#8217;s systems, the process of upgrading or patching the Company&#8217;s protective measures could itself create a risk of security issues or system disruptions for the Company, as well as for clients who rely upon, or have exposure to, BlackRock&#8217;s systems. 

In addition, due to BlackRock&#8217;s interconnectivity with third-party vendors, advisors, central agents, exchanges, clearing houses and other financial institutions, BlackRock or any such third party may be adversely affected if any of them is subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event, including those arising due to the use of mobile technology or a third-party cloud environment. BlackRock also routinely transmits and receives personal, confidential or proprietary information by email and other electronic means. The Company collaborates with clients, vendors and other third parties to develop secure transmission capabilities and protect against cyber-attacks. However, BlackRock or such third parties may not have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of such information. 

Any information security incident or cyber-attack against BlackRock or third parties with whom it is connected, including any interception, mishandling or misuse of personal, confidential or proprietary information or failure to disclose or communicate a cybersecurity incident appropriately, could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. In addition, BlackRock&#8217;s cybersecurity insurance may not cover all losses and damages from such events and BlackRock&#8217;s ability to maintain or obtain sufficient insurance coverage in the future may be limited. 

Failure or unavailability of third-party dependencies may adversely affect Aladdin operations, which could cause reputational harm, lead to a loss of clients and impede BlackRock&#8217;s productivity and growth. 

BlackRock must maintain effective infrastructure, including a robust and secure technological framework, in order to maximize the benefit of the Aladdin platform. In so doing, it relies in part on certain third-party service providers, including for cloud hosting and technologies supporting cloud-based operations. For example, Aladdin &#8217;s data architecture depends on third-party providers of technology solutions, including the ability of such parties to scale and perform in response to Aladdin &#8217;s growth. In addition, the analytical capabilities of Aladdin depend on the ability of a number of third parties to provide data and other information as inputs into Aladdin &#8217;s analytical calculations. Although BlackRock has implemented internal controls and procedures and maintains a robust vendor management program designed to perform diligence and monitor third parties that support the Aladdin platform, there can be no assurance that these measures will prove effective. Any failure by third parties to maintain infrastructure that is commensurate with Aladdin &#8217;s size and growth, or provide the data or information required to support its varying capabilities, could compromise Aladdin &#8217;s resilience, result in operational difficulties, cause reputational harm and adversely impact BlackRock&#8217;s ability to provide services to its investment advisory and Aladdin clients. 

&#160; 

Continuing enhancements to Aladdin&#8217;s capabilities, as well as the expansion of the Aladdin platform into new markets and geographies, have led to significant growth in Aladdin&#8217;s processing scale, which may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, increased regulatory scrutiny and heightened operational, data management, cyber- and information-security risks. 

The operation of BlackRock&#8217;s Aladdin platform routinely involves updating existing capabilities, configuration change management, developing, testing and rolling out new functionalities and expanding coverage into new markets and geographies, including in connection with inorganic transactions or to address client or regulatory requirements. These updates and expansion initiatives, which have led to significant growth in Aladdin &#8217;s processing scale, frequently occur on accelerated time frames and may expose BlackRock to additional cyber- and information-security risks, as well as increased execution, operational and data management risks. If BlackRock is unable to manage the pace of, or provide the operational resiliency and stability for, the expansion of Aladdin and associated growth of its processing scale, BlackRock may experience client attrition, reduced business, increased costs, reputational harm or regulatory fines and/or sanctions, which may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

In addition, the highly regulated business activities of many Aladdin clients may expose BlackRock to heightened regulatory scrutiny. For example, the changing political and regulatory environment in certain jurisdictions in which Aladdin clients are based has required BlackRock to open new data centers in those jurisdictions in order to host client data in the client&#8217;s home location. Operating new data centers in foreign jurisdictions may expose BlackRock to increased operational complexity, as well as additional regulatory risks associated with the compliance requirements of such jurisdictions. In addition, there has been increased regulatory scrutiny globally on technology and information providers, which may impact Aladdin and certain functionalities and tools. 

A failure to effectively manage the development and use of AI, combined with an evolving regulatory environment, could have an adverse effect on BlackRock&#8217;s growth, reputation or business. 

BlackRock uses machine learning and AI in its business and expects to continue to expand its AI capabilities, including through generative AI. AI methods are complex and rapidly evolving, and the introduction of AI into new or existing processes may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, IP or other litigation, data protection, confidentiality or information security risks, social or ethical concerns, competitive harm or other complications. For example, the use of datasets to develop and test AI models, the content generated by AI systems, or the application of AI systems may be found to be insufficient, biased or harmful, or lead to adverse business decisions or operating errors. AI technologies, including generative AI, may create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate or flawed. In addition, IP ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technologies have not been fully addressed by US courts or federal, state or non-US laws or regulation. Furthermore, regulation of AI technologies is evolving globally. Efforts around use of these technologies require additional investment in operational controls and procedures, development and implementation of appropriate protections and safeguards for handling the use of data with AI, including with respect to data leakage, and regulatory compliance costs. Any failure to successfully integrate AI technologies, respond to client or market demands or effectively manage the related risks could harm BlackRock&#8217;s growth and reputation, adversely impact product offerings, client interactions or business initiatives, and expose the Company to legal and regulatory liabilities and additional costs, including regulatory fines or sanctions, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Failure to maintain adequate corporate and contingent liquidity may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, as well as harm its prospects for growth. 

BlackRock&#8217;s ability to meet anticipated cash needs depends upon a number of factors, including its creditworthiness and ability to generate operating cash flows. In addition, while BlackRock, Inc. is not subject to regulatory capital or liquidity requirements, certain of its subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity frameworks as well as certain other prudential requirements and standards, which require them to maintain certain levels of capital and liquidity. Failure to maintain adequate liquidity could lead to unanticipated costs and force BlackRock to revise existing strategic and business initiatives. BlackRock&#8217;s access to equity and debt markets and its ability to issue public or private debt, or secure lines of credit or commercial paper back-up lines, on reasonable terms may be limited by adverse market conditions, a reduction in its long- or short-term credit ratings, or changes in government regulations, including tax and interest rates. Failure to obtain funds and/or financing, or any adverse change to the cost of obtaining such funds and/or financing, may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, liquidity and earnings to decline, curtail its operations and limit or impede its prospects for growth. 

Operating risks associated with BlackRock&#8217;s securities lending program may result in client losses. 

BlackRock lends securities to banks and broker-dealers on behalf of certain of its clients. In these securities lending transactions, the borrower is required to provide and maintain collateral at or above regulatory minimums. Securities on loan are marked to market daily to determine if the borrower is required to pledge additional collateral. BlackRock must manage this process and is charged with mitigating the associated operational risks. The failure of BlackRock&#8217;s controls to mitigate such operational risks could result in financial losses for the Company&#8217;s clients that participate in its securities lending programs (separate from any losses related to the risks of collateral investments), and BlackRock may be held liable for any failure to manage such risks. 

&#160; 

Inorganic transactions may harm the Company&#8217;s competitive or financial position if they are not successful. 

BlackRock employs a variety of organic and inorganic strategies intended to enhance earnings, increase product offerings, deliver whole-portfolio solutions, access new clients, leverage advances in technology and expand into new geographies. Inorganic strategies have included hiring smaller-sized investment teams, making minority investments in early- to mid-stage technological and other ventures, entering into strategic joint ventures and acquiring investment management and technology businesses, analytics, models and other IP. Inorganic transactions involve a number of financial, accounting, tax, regulatory, geographical and operational challenges and uncertainties, including in some cases, the assumption of pre-existing liabilities, which must be managed in order for BlackRock to realize the benefit of such transactions, and such transactions may be the subject of unanticipated liabilities arising from commercial disputes, information security vulnerabilities or breaches and IP or other legal claims. The success of BlackRock&#8217;s inorganic strategy also depends in large part on its ability to integrate the workforce, operations, strategies, technologies and other components of a target business following the completion of an acquisition. BlackRock may be required to commit significant management time, as well as create new, or grow existing, operational and support functions, to facilitate the integration of acquired businesses, manage combined future growth and maintain a cohesive corporate culture. There can be no assurance that BlackRock will be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, retain associated talent, scale support functions or realize other intended benefits of its inorganic strategy in the timeframe BlackRock expects, or at all. Moreover, the challenges associated with BlackRock&#8217;s inorganic strategy may be heightened when inorganic transactions are in new geographic locations, involve new markets, products, business lines or early stage investments or are delivered via technology and systems that differ from those employed by BlackRock or that overlap with existing BlackRock businesses. In addition, in the case of minority investments and joint ventures, BlackRock may be subject to risks due to reputational harm, liability or loss resulting from, or relating to operating systems, risk management controls, and employees that are outside of BlackRock&#8217;s control, as well as risks related to the jurisdictions or markets in which such investees or joint ventures operate. For example, BlackRock has a minority investment in Circle Internet Financial (&#8220;Circle&#8221;), which is associated with crypto asset markets which experienced substantial volatility and high-profile enterprise failures and bankruptcies. The crypto asset markets are subject to significant regulatory uncertainty, which could also negatively impact BlackRock&#8217;s investment in Circle. Any failure to identify and mitigate the risks associated with acquisitions, joint ventures or minority investments through due diligence, governance or oversight rights, indemnification provisions and/or operational expertise, or to manage the integration of acquisitions effectively, could result in losses or impairments related to such transactions and have an adverse effect on BlackRock&#8217;s reputation or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, which may harm the Company&#8217;s competitive position in the investment management industry. 

BlackRock is subject to risks associated with its proposed acquisition of GIP, including completion of the acquisition in the anticipated timeframe and failure to realize anticipated benefits of the acquisition. 

BlackRock is subject to risks and uncertainties associated with its proposed acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners (&#8220;GIP&#8221;), including the risk that a condition to closing may not be satisfied or waived, the possibility of failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, which may be outside of BlackRock&#8217;s or GIP&#8217;s control, or the possibility that the acquisition does not close in the anticipated timeframe or at all. BlackRock may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including synergies, value creation or other benefits of the proposed acquisition fully or at all, or on the timeline BlackRock expects. At times, the resources of either or both companies or the attention of certain members of their management may be focused on completion of the acquisition and diverted from day-to-day business operations, which may disrupt each company&#8217;s ongoing business. In addition, consummation of the acquisition may have an adverse impact on the Company, including from risks related to significant transaction costs, unknown liabilities, litigation and/or regulatory actions related to the acquisition or if the acquired business does not perform as expected, which may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock's alternatives products include investments in early-stage companies, private equity portfolio companies and real assets, such as real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, which may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to new or increased risks and liabilities, as well as reputational harm. 

BlackRock&#8217;s alternatives products include investments in early-stage companies, private equity portfolio companies and real assets, including real estate, infrastructure and energy assets, which may expose BlackRock and its funds and accounts to increased risks and liabilities that are inherent in the ownership and management of such investments and portfolio companies. These may include: 

&#8226; risks related to the potential illiquidity, valuation and disposition of such investments; 

&#8226; risks related to emerging and less established companies that have, among other things, short operating histories, new technologies and products, nascent control functions, quickly evolving markets and limited financial resources; 

&#8226; construction risks, including as a result of force majeure, labor disputes or work stoppages, shortages of material or interruptions to the availability of necessary equipment; 

&#8226; accidents, pandemics, health crises or catastrophic events, such as explosions, fires or terrorist activity beyond BlackRock&#8217;s control; 

&#8226; climate-related risks, including greater frequency or intensity of adverse weather and natural disasters; 

&#8226; personal injury or property damage; 

&#8226; failures on the part of third-party servicers and operators, including managers and contractors, appointed in connection with investments or projects to adequately perform their contractual duties or operate in accordance with applicable laws; 

&#8226; risks related to investments in emerging markets, including economic and political risks and differences in legal or regulatory environments, which may make enforcement of legal obligations more difficult; 

&#8226; exposure to stringent and complex non-US, federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those related to financial crime, permits, government contracting, conservation, exploration and production, tenancy, occupational health and safety, foreign investment and environmental protection; 

&#8226; environmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, product and waste spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of products, wastes and other pollutants; 

&#8226; changes to the supply and demand for properties and/or tenancies or fluctuations in the price of commodities; 

&#8226; risks related to the availability, cost, coverage and other limitations on insurance; 

&#8226; risks related to governance and oversight, including board oversight, of portfolio companies; 

&#160; 

&#8226; the financial resources of tenants; and 

&#8226; contingent liabilities on disposition of investments. 

The above risks may expose BlackRock&#8217;s funds and accounts to additional expenses and liabilities, including costs associated with delays or remediation, and increased legal or regulatory costs, all of which could impact the returns earned by BlackRock&#8217;s clients. These risks could also result in direct liability for BlackRock by exposing BlackRock to losses, regulatory sanctions or litigation, including claims for compensatory or punitive damages. Similarly, market conditions may change during the course of developments or projects in which BlackRock invests and those changes may make such developments or projects less attractive than at the time they were commenced and potentially harm the investment returns of BlackRock&#8217;s clients. The occurrence of any such events may expose BlackRock to reputational harm, divert management&#8217;s attention away from BlackRock&#8217;s other business activities or cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Operating in international markets increases BlackRock&#8217;s operational, political, regulatory and other risks. 

As a result of BlackRock&#8217;s extensive international operations, the Company faces associated operational, regulatory, reputational, political and foreign exchange rate risks, many of which are outside of the Company&#8217;s control. Operating outside the US may also expose BlackRock to increased compliance risks, as well as higher costs to comply with US and non-US anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and regulations. Similarly, certain jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates may not have comparable levels of protection for corporate assets, such as IP, and client information and records, to the US. As a result, there may also be heightened information security or privacy risks in those jurisdictions. Any theft or unauthorized use of data, technology or IP may negatively impact BlackRock&#8217;s business operations and reputation. In addition, changes to the political or regulatory environment in a jurisdiction in which BlackRock operates, including increased restrictions or scrutiny, may adversely impact BlackRock&#8217;s business or operating activities. The failure of the Company&#8217;s systems of internal control to mitigate such risks, or of its operating infrastructure to support its global activities, could result in operational failures and regulatory fines and/or sanctions and impede the Company's growth, which may cause the Company&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL 

The potential for human error in connection with BlackRock&#8217;s operational systems could disrupt operations, cause losses, lead to regulatory fines or damage the Company&#8217;s reputation and may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Many of BlackRock&#8217;s operations are highly complex and are dependent on the Company&#8217;s ability to process and monitor a large number of transactions, many of which occur across numerous markets and currencies at high volumes and frequencies. Although BlackRock expends considerable resources on systemic controls, supervision, technology and training in an effort to ensure that such transactions do not violate client guidelines and applicable rules and regulations or adversely affect clients, counterparties or the Company, BlackRock&#8217;s operations are dependent on its employees. From time-to-time, employees make mistakes that are not always immediately detected by systems, controls, policies and procedures intended to prevent and detect such errors. These can include calculation errors, errors in software implementation or development, failure to ensure data security, follow processes, patch systems or timely report issues, or errors in judgment. Such risks may be exacerbated in times of increased market volatility, high trading volumes or workforce turnover. Human errors, even if promptly discovered and remediated, may disrupt operations or result in regulatory fines and/or sanctions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Fraud, the circumvention of controls or the violation of risk management and workplace policies could have an adverse effect on BlackRock&#8217;s reputation, which may cause the Company&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock seeks to foster a positive workplace culture, has adopted a comprehensive risk management framework and continues to enhance various controls, procedures, policies and systems to monitor and manage risks. Notwithstanding these measures, BlackRock cannot ensure that its workplace culture or such controls, procedures, policies and systems will successfully identify and manage internal and external risks and BlackRock employees have in the past engaged in improper conduct. In addition, BlackRock is subject to the risk that its employees, contractors or other third parties may in the future deliberately or recklessly seek to circumvent established controls to commit fraud, pay or solicit bribes or otherwise act in ways that are inconsistent with the Company&#8217;s controls, policies, procedures, workplace culture or principles. This risk may be heightened as BlackRock expands into new markets and increases the breadth of its business offerings, all of which introduce additional complexity to its risk management program. The changing nature of the office environment, such as return to office arrangements and remote and alternative work models, could cause employees to become disconnected with corporate culture and policies, which may increase operational issues. Persistent attempts to circumvent policies and controls or repeated incidents involving fraud, conflicts of interests or transgressions of policies and controls could have an adverse effect on BlackRock&#8217;s reputation, cause adverse publicity, and result in litigation, regulatory inquiries, fines and/or sanctions, which may cause the Company&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

The failure to recruit, train and retain employees and develop and implement effective executive succession could lead to the loss of clients and may cause AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock&#8217;s success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of its highly skilled workforce and the Company&#8217;s ability to plan for the future long-term growth of the business by identifying and developing those employees who can ultimately transition into key roles within BlackRock. The global market for qualified fund managers, investment analysts, technology and risk specialists and other professionals is highly competitive, and factors that affect BlackRock&#8217;s ability to attract, train and retain highly qualified and diverse employees include the Company&#8217;s reputation and workplace culture, the immigration and public health policies in the jurisdictions in which BlackRock has offices, its approach to remote and alternative work models, the compensation and benefits it provides, and its commitment to effectively managing executive succession, including the development and training of qualified individuals. 

In addition, a percentage of the deferred compensation that BlackRock pays to certain of its employees is tied to the Company&#8217;s share price. As such, decreases in BlackRock&#8217;s share price could impair the retention value of such deferred compensation. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in its efforts to recruit and retain employees and effectively manage executive succession. If BlackRock is unable to offer competitive compensation or otherwise attract, develop and retain talented individuals, or if it fails to effectively manage executive succession, the Company&#8217;s ability to compete effectively and retain its existing clients may be materially impacted. 

&#160; 

RISKS RELATED TO KEY THIRD-PARTY RELATIONSHIPS 

The impairment or failure of third parties may negatively impact the performance of products and accounts that BlackRock manages, which may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock&#8217;s investment management activities expose the products and accounts it manages for its clients to many different industries and counterparties, including distributors, brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, clearing organizations, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Transactions with counterparties expose BlackRock&#8217;s clients to credit risk in the event the applicable counterparty defaults. Although BlackRock regularly assesses risks posed by its counterparties, such counterparties may be subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets that may impair their ability to perform or they may fail to meet their obligations. Counterparties may also experience lapses in their internal controls or risk management systems or expose BlackRock and/or its clients to losses resulting from employee malfeasance, negligence or human error. In addition, the concentration of certain financial institutions that BlackRock uses to facilitate securities and derivatives transactions for its clients, including clearing organizations, exchanges and central agents, increases the risk that a technical or operational issue at, or default by, one such institution could introduce operational issues or delays impacting multiple BlackRock clients. Any such operational issue, impairment or failure could negatively impact the performance of products that BlackRock manages for its clients, which may lead to client attrition and, in turn, cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

The failure of key third-party providers to BlackRock to fulfill their obligations or a failure by BlackRock to maintain its relationships with key third-party providers could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock&#8217;s growth, reputation or business, which may cause the Company&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock depends on a number of key third-party providers for various fund administration, accounting, custody, market and environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) data, market indices, insurance, technology and AI, cloud hosting and transfer agent roles and other distribution and operational needs. Further, BlackRock relies upon a relatively concentrated group of third-party index providers to deliver services that are integral to its clients&#8217; investment decisions. The index provider industry is characterized by large vendors and the use of long-term contracts remains the market standard. This industry structure may limit BlackRock&#8217;s ability to renegotiate its index provider contracts on favorable terms or at all. While BlackRock performs focused diligence on its vendors in an effort to ensure they operate in accordance with expectations, to the extent any significant deficiencies are uncovered, there may be few, or no, alternative vendors available. In addition, BlackRock&#8217;s operations and processes rely on commercially available data provided by third parties as well as providers of services, including technology services, and operating errors, process delays and failures or failures to comply with data usage requirements with respect to these service providers may adversely impact BlackRock. Data providers commonly disclaim the accuracy and completeness of data and BlackRock does not have the ability to validate or verify the accuracy and completeness of commercially sourced datasets. Moreover, in situations where BlackRock has limited access to alternative vendors, or where the nature of BlackRock&#8217;s arrangement with a vendor requires a long term-commitment, BlackRock may be dependent on such vendor for continuous operational reliability and may be unable to avoid incurring costs if such vendor introduces required upgrades to its services. 

BlackRock may from time to time transfer key contracts from one third-party provider to another. Key contract transfers may be costly and complex and expose BlackRock to heightened operational risks. Any failure to mitigate such risks could result in reputational harm, as well as financial losses to BlackRock and its clients. The failure or inability of BlackRock to diversify its sources for key services or the failure of any key third-party provider to fulfill its obligations could result in activities inconsistent with clients&#8217; investment management or other agreements, have an adverse financial impact on BlackRock products or lead to operational, legal and regulatory issues for the Company, which could result in reputational harm or legal liability, fines and/or sanctions and may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Any disruption to the Company&#8217;s distribution channels may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock relies on a number of third parties to provide distribution, portfolio administration and servicing for certain BlackRock investment management products and services through their various distribution channels. BlackRock&#8217;s ability to maintain strong relationships with its distributors may impact the Company&#8217;s future performance, and its relationships with distributors are subject to periodic renegotiation that may result in increased distribution costs and/or reductions in the amount of BlackRock products and services being marketed or distributed. Moreover, new fiduciary regulations could lead to significant shifts in distributors' business models and more limited product offerings, potentially resulting in reduced distribution and/or marketing of certain of the Company&#8217;s products and services and fee compression. If BlackRock is unable to distribute its products and services successfully or if it is unable to replace or renew existing distribution arrangements, BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings may decline. In addition, improper activities, as well as inadequate anti-money laundering diligence conducted by third-party distributors, could create reputational and regulatory harm to BlackRock. 

Key technology partnerships may expose BlackRock to increased regulatory oversight, as well as migration, execution, technology and operational risks. 

In April 2020, BlackRock announced a strategic partnership to host Aladdin infrastructure on the Microsoft Azure cloud and commenced a multi-year plan to migrate the Aladdin environments for BlackRock and its external Aladdin clients to the cloud. In addition, BlackRock has also migrated certain systems that support its corporate functions to cloud-based platforms. The benefits of cloud-based platforms are significant and BlackRock has adopted a robust risk-based approach to its migration strategies; however these partnerships also introduce new risks, including: (1) risks associated with relying on third-parties for aspects of infrastructure reliability and stability; (2) software and information security risks arising from the use of cloud technology; (3) operational and execution risks, including those related to migration; and (4) risks related to increased regulatory oversight and new compliance obligations, which risks may be further exacerbated as BlackRock and the Aladdin platform continue to grow. Failures by BlackRock to manage these risks, and/or risks associated with future potential technology partnerships, may result in escalating costs, financial loss, client dissatisfaction or attrition, regulatory fines and/or sanctions, reputational harm or legal liability, which, in turn, may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

&#160; 

Disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to BlackRock&#8217;s exchange-traded fund (&#8220;ETF&#8221;) platform may adversely affect the prices at which ETFs trade, particularly during periods of market volatility. 

BlackRock is the largest provider of ETFs globally. Shares of ETFs trade on stock exchanges at prices at, above or below the ETF&#8217;s most recent net asset value (&#8220;NAV&#8221;). The NAV of an ETF is calculated at least once daily, generally at the end of each business day, and fluctuates with changes in the market value of the ETF&#8217;s holdings. The trading price of the ETF&#8217;s shares fluctuates continuously throughout trading hours. The creation/redemption feature and arbitrage mechanism of an ETF are designed to make it more likely that the ETF&#8217;s shares normally will trade at prices close to the NAV. Notwithstanding these features, exchange prices have in the past deviated measurably from the NAV of certain ETFs and may under certain circumstances do so in the future. ETF market prices are subject to numerous potential risks, including trading halts invoked by a stock exchange, and the inability or unwillingness of market makers, authorized participants, settlement systems or other market participants to perform functions necessary for an ETF&#8217;s arbitrage mechanism to function effectively. These risks may be heightened as a result of significant market volatility, the growth of the ETF industry combined with increased market activity, as well as the complexity associated with certain products or asset classes. Moreover, if market events lead to incidences where ETFs trade at prices that deviate meaningfully from an ETF&#8217;s NAV, or trading halts are invoked by the relevant stock exchange or market, investors may lose confidence in ETF products and redeem their holdings, which may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

LEGAL, REGULATORY AND REPUTATIONAL RISKS 

BlackRock is subject to extensive regulation around the world, which increases its cost of doing business. 

BlackRock&#8217;s business is subject to extensive regulation around the world. These regulations subject BlackRock&#8217;s business activities to an array of increasingly detailed operational requirements, compliance with which is costly and complex. 

In addition, many of BlackRock&#8217;s legal entities are subject to laws and regulations aimed at preventing corruption, money laundering, inappropriate employment practices, illegal payments and engaging in business activities with certain individuals, countries or groups, including but not limited to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives, the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds Regulations 2017, the UK Bribery Act, sanctions imposed by the US Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the United Nations and the EU and its member states, as well as those imposed by other countries in which BlackRock operates, such as His Majesty&#8217;s Treasury&#8217;s (&#8220;HMT&#8221;) Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation. 

BlackRock is also subject to certain risk retention rules and regulation, as well as regulatory capital requirements, which require the Company to maintain capital to support certain of its businesses. Furthermore, many jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and protection of personal information, including the GDPR and UK GDPR, which impose stringent data protection rules for individuals within the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;) and UK, respectively, and for personal data exported outside the EEA and UK. 

BlackRock is additionally subject to scrutiny from various government agencies that focus on antitrust and competition laws and regulations within the US and internationally, including in connection with merger control proceedings and proposed investments. Any determination of a failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions against the Company, as well as reputational harm. Moreover, to the extent that these laws and regulations become more stringent, or if BlackRock is required to hold increased levels of capital to support its businesses, the Company&#8217;s financial performance or plans for growth may be adversely impacted. 

BlackRock may also be adversely affected by a failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, including those discussed above. Challenges associated with interpreting regulations issued in numerous countries in a globally consistent manner may add to such risks if regulators in different jurisdictions have inconsistent views or provide only limited regulatory guidance. In particular, violation of applicable laws or regulations could result in fines and/or sanctions, temporary or permanent prohibition of certain activities, reputational harm and related client terminations, suspensions of employees or revocation of their licenses, suspension or termination of investment adviser, broker-dealer or other registrations, or suspension or termination of BTC&#8217;s bank charter or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on BlackRock&#8217;s reputation or business and may cause the Company&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. For a more extensive discussion of the laws, regulations and regulators to which BlackRock is subject and regulated by, see Item 1, Business &#8211; Regulation . 

New regulations informed by global standard setters and/or developed by various national authorities may expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs in the jurisdictions in which it operates. 

Policymaking workstreams focused on the financial services sector led by global standard setters, such as the Financial Stability Board (&#8220;FSB&#8221;) and International Organization of Securities Commissions (&#8220;IOSCO&#8221;), may lead to or inform new regulations in multiple jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates. Such workstreams have focused on areas such as money market funds (&#8220;MMFs&#8221;), open-ended funds (&#8220;OEFs&#8221;) and sustainability regulations. BlackRock is, and may become, subject to increasing regulation in these areas, see Item 1, Business &#8211; Regulation , including: 

&#8226; Macroprudential Policies for Asset Managers: Concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector have been heightened since the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforced by the Liquidity Driven Investment events in the UK. This has prompted a broad review of existing regulations globally, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural market components in mitigating risks by the FSB, IOSCO, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (&#8220;FSOC&#8221;). In November 2022, the SEC proposed amendments to rules governing OEF liquidity risk management and swing pricing. The EU also proposed reforms to increase the availability of liquidity management tools to OEFs (including MMFs), enhance reporting on the use of liquidity management tools by OEFs to national regulators and allow such regulators to require OEF managers to activate liquidity management tools in extreme market conditions. Meanwhile, the UK proposed introducing liquidity facilities to certain asset owners, which could result in regulatory burdens on asset managers. If any of these regulatory or policy actions result in broad application of macroprudential tools to OEFs or require changes to structural features of certain OEFs, it could limit BlackRock&#8217;s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Global MMF Reforms: Following the market events of March 2020, US, UK and EU authorities initiated a review of existing regulatory frameworks with the aim of improving the resilience of MMFs in market downturns. In the US, the SEC adopted changes to Rule 2a-7, the primary rule under the Investment Company Act of 1940 governing MMFs, including changes to required liquidity levels and certain operational aspects of such funds, and requiring mandatory liquidity fees under certain circumstances. The UK released a consultation in December 2023 indicating their intent to change regulatory requirements for MMFs domiciled or marketed in the UK, including material increases in required liquidity levels. Although EU authorities stated in July 2023 that they would not re-open the EU regulatory framework for MMFs in the near term, the UK&#8217;s proposed changes may increase pressure to implement similar reforms as the vast majority of MMFs sold in the UK are EU-domiciled and regulated. Such regulatory reforms could significantly and adversely impact certain of BlackRock&#8217;s MMF products. 

&#8226; ESG and Sustainability: ESG and sustainability have been the subject of increased regulatory focus across jurisdictions. The International Sustainability Standards Board (&#8220;ISSB&#8221;) released its first two disclosure standards in 2023, which may inform national regulators&#8217; approaches. For example, the UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia have already indicated their intention to endorse these standards. In the US, the SEC has proposed a series of rules that would require, among other things: (1) corporate issuers to make substantial climate-related disclosures in periodic reports, including with respect to governance, risk management, business strategy, financial statement metrics and greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) emissions and (2) enhanced ESG disclosures by investment companies and investment advisers in fund and adviser filings, including disclosures on ESG strategies and how ESG factors are considered, and GHG emissions disclosure by certain environmentally focused funds. Furthermore, the SEC has announced plans to propose rules to require enhanced disclosure regarding human capital management and board diversity for public issuers. It has also increased scrutiny of disclosure and compliance issues relating to investment advisers&#8217; and funds&#8217; ESG strategies, policies and procedures. In addition, the US Department of Labor (&#8220;DOL&#8221;) issued final rules clarifying that Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;) plan fiduciaries can, but are not required to, consider the economic effects of ESG factors for purposes of investing ERISA plan assets and exercising voting rights with respect to plan investments. Moreover, California passed several laws in 2023 that will require companies doing business in California to make certain types of climate-related disclosures, and other states may adopt similar laws . 

The EU has enacted numerous regulations on ESG and sustainability, including on sustainability-related disclosures by financial market participants; integration of sustainability considerations into investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors; making the advice and financial product distribution process more receptive to end-investor sustainability preferences; and requiring asset managers to report against an EU-wide taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities and make detailed disclosures relating to ESG characteristics of funds and portfolios. Further regulations include the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which will require enhanced sustainability reporting for EU-based corporate issuers, with phased implementation beginning in 2024 and for a wider group of global companies from 2028. In December 2023, the EU reached provisional agreement on a directive, which if adopted in its current form, would require a wide group of European and global companies to provide transition plans and conduct due diligence on the sustainability of their suppliers. The EU and the UK Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) are also developing rules and guidelines for the use of ESG or sustainability related terms in fund names, focused on specifying a minimum threshold of assets meeting ESG or sustainable criteria for such funds. Within the UK, the FCA has proposed UK-specific sustainability regulations, including a sustainable product classification system for funds and enhanced disclosure requirements, which are expected to apply on a staggered basis from July 2024. In addition, HMT released a consultation to bring ESG rating providers under regulation by the FCA and will consult on a UK-specific taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities. 

A number of Asia-Pacific jurisdictions are consulting on sustainability reporting obligations aligned with the ISSB standards. Similarly, policymakers in Japan have announced that they are preparing a local version of the ISSB standards. Japan and Singapore have published codes of conduct for ESG data and ratings providers, with Hong Kong considering a similar approach, while India introduced a regulatory framework for ESG ratings providers in July 2023. 

As jurisdictions continue to develop legal frameworks on ESG and sustainability regulations, BlackRock faces increased fragmentation risk related to local implementation, resulting in complex and potentially conflicting compliance obligations and legal and regulatory uncertainty. 

Global regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and increase costs, including costs related to regulatory compliance, result in litigation, impede the Company&#8217;s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock&#8217;s clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock. 

Regulatory reforms in the US expose BlackRock to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty. 

In recent years, a number of regulatory reforms have been proposed or fully or partially implemented in the US, and the level of regulatory scrutiny to which BlackRock is subject has increased. These risks have been heightened as the pace of regulatory rulemaking has intensified. BlackRock, as well as its clients, vendors and distributors, have expended resources and altered certain of their business or operating activities to prepare for, address and meet the requirements that such regulatory reforms impose. While BlackRock is, and may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives in the US, see Item 1, Business &#8211; Regulation , key regulatory reforms that may impact the Company include: 

&#8226; Antitrust Rules and Guidance: In 2023, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the &#8220;DOJ&#8221;) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking with amendments to rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (&#8220;HSR&#8221;) that require parties in certain transactions to provide the FTC and DOJ prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would significantly expand the information required to be reported and documentation to be submitted in connection with an HSR filing. If enacted as drafted, the proposed rules could substantially increase BlackRock&#8217;s pre-merger notification expenses and delay transactions. In December 2023, the FTC and DOJ also jointly issued new merger guidelines, which could impact the ability of the Company to expand its services through strategic investments or acquisitions. 

&#8226; Designation as a Systemically Important Financial Institution (&#8220;SIFI&#8221;): The FSOC has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the US under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. In November 2023, the FSOC finalized amendments to its existing interpretive guidance to remove the prioritization of an activities-based approach over an entity-specific approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks to financial stability, although the amendment clarified that the FSOC retained the ability to use an activities-based approach when appropriate. If BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory and capital requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve. 

&#160; 

&#8226; US DOL Fiduciary Rule: In October 2023, the US DOL proposed a new regulation redefining the meaning of &#8220;investment advice fiduciary&#8221; under ERISA as well as amendments to several prohibited transaction exemptions applicable to investment advice fiduciaries. If adopted as proposed, the rule would substantially expand when a person would be considered a fiduciary subject to ERISA and could require BlackRock to revise a number of its distribution relationships, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock and its distribution partners, and limit BlackRock&#8217;s ability to provide certain services to applicable clients. 

&#8226; SEC Rules Governing Security-Based Swaps: In 2021, the SEC proposed rules in connection with security-based swaps (&#8220;SBS&#8221;) transactions to require public reporting of large SBS positions. These rules, if adopted as proposed, may affect the types of transactions BlackRock may choose to execute in SBS or other SBS-related assets, introduce or increase costs relating to such transactions, and impact the liquidity in the SBS markets in which BlackRock transacts. 

&#8226; SEC Rules on Private Fund Advisers : In 2023, the SEC adopted new rules and amendments to enhance regulation of private fund advisors. These included amendments to Form PF for registered investment advisers requiring new disclosures, filing obligations and enhanced reporting. The SEC adopted additional rules requiring registered private fund advisers to, among other things, provide quarterly reports to fund investors, obtain annual audits for funds, distribute fairness opinions in connection with certain transactions, prohibit certain types of preferential terms and treatment, and provide transparency to investors of all types of preferential treatment granted to other investors in the same fund. Implementing these rules and amendments may significantly increase BlackRock&#8217;s reporting, disclosure and compliance obligations and create operational complexity for BlackRock&#8217;s alternatives products. 

&#8226; Proposed Rules on Regulation ATS : In 2023, the SEC re-proposed amendments to Regulation ATS. The proposed rules would expand the types of systems that could fall within the definition of &#8220;exchange&#8221; and extend Regulation ATS and Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity to systems involving US government securities trading. If enacted as proposed, these rules may increase compliance costs for BlackRock. 

&#8226; SEC US Treasury Clearing Mandate: In December 2023, the SEC adopted rules mandating central clearing of US Treasury repurchases and certain other Treasury transactions. The rules require many market participants, including a large number of BlackRock funds and accounts, to clear Treasury repurchase transactions and potentially certain cash Treasury securities transactions through a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which could increase transaction costs for BlackRock&#8217;s clients. 

&#8226; Proposed Rules on Equity Market Structure: In 2023, the SEC proposed equity market structure reforms that would significantly change how national market system (&#8220;NMS&#8221;) stock orders are priced, executed and reported. The reforms include: (1) a requirement for certain retail orders to be subject to order-by-order competition, (2) an SEC-level best execution rule and (3) an adjustment to the tick sizes at which NMS stocks can be quoted or traded. If enacted as proposed, the collective impact of the rules may adversely affect market efficiency and execution costs, which would result in negative effects for BlackRock&#8217;s business and clients. 

&#8226; SEC Rules on Short Sales and Reporting of Securities Loans: In 2023, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring certain institutional managers to report short positions and activity to the SEC for publication on an aggregate basis, which could potentially impact investment strategies and result in greater operational burdens and cost for BlackRock. The SEC also adopted a new rule requiring certain persons to report information on securities loan transactions to a registered national securities association which will then publish certain information. The rule may increase BlackRock&#8217;s operational burdens and costs. 

&#8226; SEC Standard Settlement Rules: In 2023, the SEC adopted amendments and new rules which, among other things, shortened the standard settlement for most securities transactions to one business day after the trade date (T+1), which will likely increase BlackRock&#8217;s operational burdens and costs. 

&#8226; SEC Predictive Data Analytics Rules: The SEC proposed new rules in 2023 that would require broker-dealers and investment advisers, when engaging or communicating with investors using predictive data analytics (&#8220;PDA&#8221;) and PDA-like technologies, to evaluate such technologies for conflicts of interest and, where identified, eliminate or neutralize the conflict of interest. If adopted as proposed, the rules could encompass a wide range of forward-looking uses of technology applications and impose significant operational burdens and costs. 

&#8226; SEC Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers: The SEC has recently engaged in various initiatives and reviews impacting regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies. For example, the SEC adopted rules requiring certain funds to provide tailored fund shareholder reports, adopted final amendments to the rule governing fund names, expanding the scope of the rule to fund names including growth, value, ESG or similar terms, and proposed rules governing outsourcing of certain functions by investment advisers to service providers. 

Regulatory reforms in the US could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, increase regulatory compliance costs, result in litigation, impede the Company&#8217;s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock&#8217;s clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock. 

International regulatory reforms expose BlackRock and its clients to increasing regulatory scrutiny, as well as regulatory uncertainty. 

BlackRock&#8217;s business and operating activities are subject to increasing regulatory oversight outside of the US and the Company may be affected by several proposed or implemented reform initiatives in the EMEA and the Asia-Pacific regions, as well as volatility associated with international regulatory uncertainty. While BlackRock is, and may become, subject to numerous reform initiatives internationally, see Item 1, Business &#8211; Regulation , key reforms in these regions include: 

European Union 

&#8226; Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms: The EU&#8217;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (&#8220;DORA&#8221;), which focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services, will become applicable beginning in January 2025. DORA will, among other things: (1) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing and information sharing requirements to several of BlackRock&#8217;s European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (2) potentially subject Aladdin to additional oversight. In parallel with DORA, the UK proposed a new Critical Third Party regime to regulate certain third parties designated by HMT as &#8220;critical&#8221; to the financial sector, and UK regulators have issued a consultation on proposed requirements for &#8220;critical&#8221; third parties, with further consultations expected in 2024. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Retail Investment Strategy: In 2023, the European Commission (&#8220;EC&#8221;) adopted a Retail Investment Strategy package with wide-reaching amendments intended to enhance protections for retail investors. If enacted as proposed, these changes may impact BlackRock&#8217;s operations in European markets, including product development, client servicing and distribution models. 

United Kingdom 

&#8226; FSMA 2023: The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (&#8220;FSMA&#8221;) reflects significant changes to the UK framework for financial services regulation, including changes that: (1) revoke retained EU law related to financial services regulation, (2) amend the UK Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation frameworks, (3) establish a new designated activities regime and (4) reform the financial promotion regime for unauthorized firms. The UK government and FCA are expected to publish further legislation setting out specific changes impacting the UK market in 2024. 

&#8226; Mansion House Reforms: The Mansion House reforms announced in July 2023 also build on the new UK regulatory framework enabled by the FSMA. Potential impacts to the asset management sector include: (1) repeal and replacement of the packaged retail and insurance based investment products ("PRIIPs") Regulation; (2) review of the UK&#8217;s green finance strategy, including potential regulation of ESG data providers; (3) review of governance through the Senior Managers and Certification Regime; (4) repeal of EU legislation on the European Long-Term Investment Fund; (5) market infrastructure reforms; (6) reassessment of the boundary between investment advice and financial guidance; and (7) independent review of the UK investment research landscape. 

&#8226; Overseas Fund Regime (&#8220;OFR&#8221;): OFR, the simplified regime through which non-UK funds can register with the FCA to be marketed to UK retail investors, was enacted in February 2022 and is expected to be implemented through 2024. OFR requires consumer protection regimes in EU countries where BlackRock funds are domiciled to be found equivalent to the UK&#8217;s regime in order to market such funds in the UK. 

&#8226; Conduct Regulation: The FCA continues to focus on conduct regulation, including the implementation of the Consumer Duty by all asset management firms, including BlackRock&#8217;s UK subsidiaries. The Consumer Duty rules require firms to act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers in their manufacture and distribution of products and services, in respect of price and value, consumer understanding and consumer support. Any failure to meet the FCA&#8217;s regulatory expectations could expose BlackRock to regulatory sanctions and increased reputational risk. 

&#8226; UK Stewardship Code Review: The UK Financial Reporting Council has announced a planned review of the UK Stewardship Code in 2024 to consider potential revisions to address stakeholder concerns. 

Asia-Pacific 

&#8226; Regulatory Environment in China: The Company&#8217;s operations in China are subject to a number of regulatory risks, including an evolving regulatory environment and complex data security and data transfer regulations. These factors may increase compliance risk and costs, limit the Company&#8217;s ability to source and execute new investment opportunities and lead to impairment losses on its investments. Restrictions on transfers of certain types of onshore data of the Company&#8217;s Chinese entities to offshore entities also may limit BlackRock&#8217;s ability to aggregate, report and monitor such data on its global platform. In addition, a number of regulators in China have jurisdiction over BlackRock&#8217;s business operations, increasing operational and regulatory engagement complexity. These risks may be further heightened by additional scrutiny by Chinese regulators of certain sectors, such as technology and other industries that might be deemed to be of national importance. 

International regulatory reforms could require BlackRock to alter its future business or operating activities, which could be time-consuming and costly, increase regulatory compliance costs, result in litigation, impede the Company&#8217;s growth and cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. Regulatory reform may also impact BlackRock&#8217;s clients, which could cause them to change their investment strategies or allocations in manners that may be adverse to BlackRock. 

Legal proceedings may cause the Company&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

BlackRock is subject to a number of sources of potential legal liability and the Company, certain of the investment funds it manages and certain of its subsidiaries and employees have been named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation arising in connection with BlackRock&#8217;s activities. Certain of BlackRock&#8217;s subsidiaries and employees are also subject to periodic examination, special inquiries and potential proceedings by regulatory authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;), Department of Labor, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Financial Conduct Authority, Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financial and Federal Reserve. Similarly, from time to time, BlackRock receives subpoenas or other requests for information from various US state and federal as well as non-US governmental and regulatory authorities in connection with certain industry-wide, company-specific or other investigations, proceedings or litigations. These examinations, inquiries and proceedings have in the past and could in the future, if compliance failures or other violations are found, cause the relevant governmental or regulatory authority to institute proceedings and/or impose sanctions for violations. Any such action may also result in litigation by investors in BlackRock&#8217;s funds, other BlackRock clients or BlackRock&#8217;s shareholders. Such legal proceedings could harm the Company&#8217;s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline, potentially harm the investment returns of the applicable fund, or result in the Company being liable for damages. 

In addition, when clients retain BlackRock to manage their assets or provide them with products or services, they typically specify contractual requirements or guidelines that BlackRock must observe in the provision of its services. A failure to comply with these guidelines or requirements could expose BlackRock to lawsuits, harm its reputation or cause clients to withdraw assets or terminate contracts. 

&#160; 

BlackRock faces increasing focus from regulators, officials, clients and other stakeholders regarding ESG matters, which may adversely impact its reputation and business. 

BlackRock faces increasing focus from regulators, officials, clients and other stakeholders regarding ESG matters. BlackRock offers choice to its clients who have a variety of goals and preferences, including those who want to increase their exposure to the low-carbon transition and those who choose not to invest in products or strategies with sustainable investment objectives. BlackRock is subject to competing demands from different stakeholder groups with divergent views on ESG-related matters, including in countries in which BlackRock operates and invests, as well as in states and localities where BlackRock serves public sector clients. This divergence has and continues to increase the risk that any perceived or actual action or lack thereof by BlackRock on such matters on behalf of its clients will be viewed differently by various stakeholders and adversely impact BlackRock&#8217;s reputation and business, including through withdrawals, redemptions, terminations or decisions not to commit or invest new capital by clients, as well as legal and governmental action and scrutiny. Some US states and state officials have adopted or proposed legislation or otherwise have taken official positions restricting or prohibiting state government entities from doing certain business with entities identified by the state as &#8220;boycotting&#8221; or &#8220;discriminating&#8221; against particular industries or considering ESG factors in their investment processes and proxy voting. Other states and localities may adopt similar legislation or other ESG-related laws and positions that adversely impact BlackRock&#8217;s business. BlackRock may also communicate certain initiatives and goals for its corporate activities related to environmental, diversity, and other ESG-related matters. BlackRock could be criticized for the scope or nature of any initiatives or goals, or for revisions thereto. Such initiatives or goals may be difficult or costly to implement, may not advance at the anticipated pace, or be accomplished within the announced timeframe or at all. If BlackRock is not able to successfully manage ESG-related expectations across varied stakeholder interests, it may adversely affect BlackRock&#8217;s reputation, ability to attract and retain clients, employees, shareholders and business partners or result in litigation, legal or governmental action, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Damage to BlackRock&#8217;s reputation may harm its business. 

BlackRock&#8217;s reputation is critical to its relationships with its clients, employees, shareholders and business partners. BlackRock&#8217;s reputation may be harmed by, among other factors, regulatory, enforcement or other governmental actions, technology or operational failures, poor investment performance, ineffective management or monitoring of key third-party relationships, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, privacy incidents, employee errors or misconduct, failures to manage risks or conflicts of interest, or legal actions related to BlackRock or its products and services. In addition, BlackRock&#8217;s business, scale and investments subject it to significant media coverage and increasing attention from a broad range of stakeholders. This heightened scrutiny has resulted in negative publicity and adverse actions for BlackRock and may continue to do so in the future. Any perceived or actual action or lack thereof, or perceived lack of transparency, by BlackRock on matters subject to scrutiny, such as ESG, may be viewed differently by various stakeholders and adversely impact BlackRock&#8217;s reputation and business, including through redemptions or terminations by clients, and legal and governmental action and scrutiny. BlackRock&#8217;s global presence and investments on behalf of its clients around the world could also lead to heightened scrutiny and criticism in an increasingly fragmented geopolitical landscape. For example, BlackRock has received criticism from some stakeholders because of its operations and investments in certain countries on behalf of clients, including China. These criticisms could adversely impact BlackRock&#8217;s reputation and business. In addition, the increasing popularity of social media and non-mainstream Internet news sources may lead to faster and wider dissemination of adverse publicity or inaccurate information about BlackRock, making effective remediation more difficult. Damage to BlackRock&#8217;s reputation may impact BlackRock&#8217;s ability to attract and retain clients, employees, shareholders and business partners, which may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

A failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest could result in litigation or enforcement actions and/or adversely affect BlackRock&#8217;s business and reputation, which may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

As a global investment management firm that provides investment and technology services to a diverse range of clients, the Company must routinely address and manage conflicts of interest, as well as the perception of conflicts of interest, between itself and its clients, employees or vendors. While BlackRock has policies, controls and disclosure protocols in place to manage and address potential conflicts of interest, identifying and mitigating conflicts of interest can be complex and is the subject of increasing regulatory and media scrutiny. It is possible that actual, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to investor or client dissatisfaction, adverse publicity, litigation or enforcement actions. In particular, BlackRock&#8217;s broad range of investment, advisory and technology offerings, and its focus on providing clients with whole portfolio solutions, may result in clients working with multiple BlackRock businesses and/or BlackRock being engaged by institutions that have a nexus to industries or jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates, which may increase the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest and improper information sharing. To the extent that BlackRock fails, or appears to fail, to deal appropriately with any conflict of interest, it may face adverse publicity, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory proceedings, client attrition, penalties, fines and/or sanctions, any of which may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

A subsidiary of BlackRock is subject to US banking regulations that may limit its business activities. 

BlackRock&#8217;s trust bank subsidiary, which is a national banking association chartered by the OCC, is subject to OCC regulation and capital requirements that may limit its business activities. The OCC has broad supervisory and enforcement authority over BlackRock&#8217;s trust bank. Having a subsidiary subject to banking regulation may put BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage because certain of its competitors are not subject to the limitations imposed by such regulation. 

The implications of complying with threshold limits and/or any failure to comply with ownership reporting requirements could result in harm to BlackRock&#8217;s reputation, impact the performance of certain BlackRock funds and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

Of note among the various regulations to which BlackRock is subject are the extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. The specific triggers and the reporting methods that these threshold filings entail vary significantly by regulator and across jurisdictions. BlackRock continues to invest in technology, training and its employees to further enhance its monitoring and reporting functions. Despite these investments, the complexity of the various threshold reporting requirements combined with the breadth of the assets managed by the Company and high volume of securities trading have caused errors and omissions to occur in the past and pose a risk that errors or omissions may occur in the future. Any such errors may expose BlackRock to monetary penalties or other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on BlackRock&#8217;s reputation and may cause its AUM, revenue and earnings to decline. 

&#160; 

Moreover, as BlackRock&#8217;s business grows it is becoming subject to a greater number of regulatory, industry-level or issuer-specific threshold limits and scrutiny that may prevent BlackRock from holding positions in certain equity securities, securities convertible into equity securities or futures contracts in excess of certain thresholds. Although BlackRock is actively engaged in regulatory, issuer-specific and structural initiatives to create additional investment capacity, threshold limits may nonetheless prevent the purchase of certain securities which may, in turn, impact the performance of certain BlackRock index funds by increasing tracking error relative to the funds&#8217; benchmarks, impact the performance of certain BlackRock actively managed funds by preventing them from taking advantage of alpha generating opportunities, and impede the Company's growth. 

BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the scale of its index investing business, as well as purported competition issues relating to the common ownership theory. 

As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing and concentrated proxy voting power. Some commentators have argued that continued growth of index funds has the potential to impact stock market competitiveness by exacerbating stock price moves and market volatility. Some commentators, regulators and lawmakers have also argued that index managers have accumulated outsized influence through the proxy voting power their clients have assigned them. Some have proposed limitations on the ability of index fund managers to vote on behalf of their clients, or that voting and engagement on certain topics should trigger changes in regulatory status. Additional commentary focuses on the common ownership theory, an academic theory stating that minority ownership of multiple companies within a single industry by the same investor leads to anticompetitive effects. This theory purports to link aggregated equity positions in certain industries with higher consumer prices and executive compensation and lower wages and employment rates, among other things. In the US, the FTC cited common ownership as a disqualifying factor in a proposed exemption from pre-merger notification rules and as a consideration underlying its consultation on rules applying to acquisitions of voting securities by investment entities. In 2021, the FTC identified common ownership as a key enforcement area and passed a resolution empowering individual commissioners to investigate shareholder conduct in connection with common ownership. In 2023, the FTC and DOJ released new merger guidelines recognizing that common ownership may reduce competitive incentives. Common ownership may be given greater consideration in regulatory investigations, studies, rule proposals, policy decisions and/or the scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions. The debate on common ownership is still on the agenda of competition regulators globally, and common ownership may continue to be a consideration for the EC, among others, including in the assessment of mergers and investigations. For example, EC and European Parliament reports in 2020 suggested that more evidence was required on the impact of common ownership on competition, and a committee of the Australian House of Representatives held an inquiry in 2021 on the implications of common ownership and capital concentration on Australian companies and markets. In 2023, the UK Competition &#38; Markets Authority (&#8220;CMA&#8221;) established a new economic research unit which identified common ownership as a potential research topic. There is substantial literature casting doubt on the assumptions, data, methodology and conclusions associated with the common ownership theory and competition regulators, including at the FTC and CMA, have acknowledged that the debate around the theory remains unsettled. Nevertheless, some commentators have proposed remedies, including limits on the ownership stakes of common owners that, if enacted into policy, could have a negative impact on the capital markets, as well as increase costs and limit the availability of products for investors. Such policy solutions could, in turn, adversely affect BlackRock. 

New tax legislation or changes to existing US and non-US tax laws, treaties and regulations or challenges to BlackRock&#8217;s historical taxation practices may adversely affect BlackRock&#8217;s effective tax rate, business and overall financial condition. 

BlackRock&#8217;s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. Legislation at both the US federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax (&#8220;FTT&#8221;) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the EU, certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the EC has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock&#8217;s financial results and clients&#8217; performance results. 

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (&#8220;OECD&#8221;) has proposed certain international tax reforms, which, among other things, would (1) shift taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consumer and (2) establish a global minimum tax for multinational companies of 15% (namely the &#8220;Pillar One&#8221; and &#8220;Pillar Two&#8221; Framework). EU member states adopted, or plan to adopt, laws implementing the OECD&#8217;s minimum tax rules under the Pillar Two Framework, which are expected to go into effect in 2024. Several other countries, including the UK, have changed or are considering changes to their tax law to implement the OECD&#8217;s minimum tax proposal. As a result of these developments, the tax laws of certain countries in which BlackRock does business have and may continue to change, and any such changes could increase its tax liabilities. The Company is continuing to monitor legislative developments and evaluate the potential impact of the Pillar Two Framework on future periods. 

The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties, and in the normal course of business US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock&#8217;s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.
