For a discussion of certain risks applicable to our business, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this report. 

Acquisitions and Divestitures 

General 

Since being incorporated in 1968, we have grown principally through acquisitions. By 2008, we had become one of the largest providers of rural telephone services in the United States. Since then, we acquired Embarq Corporation in mid-2009, Qwest Communications International Inc. in early 2011 and Level 3 Communications, Inc. in late 2017. These acquisitions substantially changed our customer base, geographic footprint, business strategies and mix of products and services. 

We continue to evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional assets or divesting assets in exchange for cash, securities or other properties, and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions or divestitures. We generally do not announce our acquisitions or divestitures until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement. 

Divestitures of the Latin American, ILEC and EMEA Businesses 

On August 1, 2022, affiliates of Level 3 Parent, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Lumen Technologies, Inc., sold Lumen&#8217;s Latin American business. On October 3, 2022, we and certain of our affiliates sold the portion of our facilities-based ILEC business primarily conducted within 20 Midwestern and Southeastern states. On November 1, 2023, affiliates of Level 3 Parent, LLC sold Lumen's operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (the "EMEA business"). 

See Note 2&#8212;Divestitures of the Latin American, ILEC and EMEA Businesses to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information on these transactions.

Strategy 

Our over-arching strategic goal is to digitally connect people, data, and applications quickly, securely, and effortlessly. To attain this goal, we strive to, among other things: 

&#8226; strengthen our digital self-service product ordering platforms; 

&#8226; expand our offering of secure edge computing services; 

&#8226; create a more adaptive network; 

&#8226; expand our network capacity through our Quantum Fiber buildout plan and other initiatives; 

&#8226; monetize our non-core assets and deliver cost-effective operations; 

&#8226; manage our non-fiber business for cash flow; and 

&#8226; strengthen our financial position and performance through debt and cost reduction efforts. 

Our Stakeholders 

We believe that regular communications with our stakeholders is a vital component of Lumen's success. Our "North Star" guides us to operate with transparency and infuses clarity into the communications we have with all of our stakeholders including our investors, employees, customers, vendors, partners and our global community. 

Employees and Human Capital Resources 

To position Lumen for growth and success, we have made changes to our executive leadership team that have played a critical role in modernizing our business, attracting new talent and invigorating our culture. Lumen&#8217;s highly competitive business requires attracting, developing and retaining a motivated team inspired by leadership, engaged in meaningful work, motivated by career growth opportunities and thriving in a culture that embraces diversity, inclusion and belonging. Understanding and anticipating the priorities of our current and future employees is important to our future success. We aim to bring together the best mix of diverse talent to develop the brightest ideas to transform industries across the globe. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately 28,000 employees world-wide, including approximately 3,700 outside the U.S. 

Attracting, Developing and Retaining Talent 

Our recruiting, development and retention objectives focus on treating talent as a differentiator and a leading indicator of business performance. We strive to hire and retain the best talent available to provide outstanding opportunities for career advancement and to champion fair selections and best hiring practices. We have implemented diverse interview panels, which include at least one woman or person of color, to minimize the potential for unconscious bias in our recruitment process. We have also developed a non-biased pre-hire assessment process. We have established a framework of competency-based success profiles and regular career development and training programs, which we believe empower our employees to pursue their professional goals and improve employee engagement and retention. We invest in broad-based development for our employees in various ways such as skills-building programs, on-demand learning options, tuition reimbursement and tailored intern and mentoring programs, along with a suite of leadership development courses. In an effort to create more development opportunities for all employees, we are expanding our mentoring and leadership development programs, with added focus on development for diverse employees. 

We believe we have made significant strides in attracting, engaging, and hiring a diverse group of early career employees through our internship program, our numerous sales and operations academies, and our "pathways in technology" program. We have also increased our focus on fostering internal mobility and providing more visibility and career advancement opportunities to our workforce through our internal communications platforms. Developing strong leaders who can move our company forward is a priority for Lumen. 

We gauge the efficacy of our programs, identify opportunities for improvement, and pursue solutions through tracking and analyzing data in a variety of ways, including conducting annual talent reviews and measuring our progress toward goals specified in our development, diversity and inclusion plans. 

Diversity, Inclusion &#38; Belonging 

We believe that diversity stimulates creativity, spurs innovation and helps drive profitability, which is why we strive to create inclusive, welcoming workplaces where everyone can feel at home, be their authentic selves and thrive. Realizing greater diversity across all levels of an organization is, and will continue to be, an ongoing journey. Our Diversity &#38; Inclusion Steering Committee, comprised of a cross-functional team of senior executives, including our Chief Diversity &#38; Inclusion Officer, oversees and champions our diversity, inclusion and belonging strategy. We aim for the highest standards of fairness and equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, promotions, job assignments and compensation (including undertaking periodic gender and race/ethnicity pay equity studies of our U.S., non-represented employees and making pay adjustments when warranted). Inclusive recruiting and outreach programs for diverse candidates, supportive and engaging employee resource groups, and management-led listening circles are among some of Lumen&#8217;s initiatives to create greater diversity and belonging among our employees. 

Positive Corporate Culture 

Our employees are critical to Lumen's success and we believe creating a positive, inclusive culture is essential to attracting and retaining engaged employees. We want our employees to be proud to work with us and fully engaged to share in our purpose maximize the world's digital potential. Lumen is transforming from the bottom up by building a culture of teamwork, trust, and transparency. Lumen's cultural transformation strategy incorporates a wide variety of communication and training activities encouraging collaboration among our colleagues around the world. We measure the program&#8217;s efficacy and identify opportunities for improvements through an engagement survey distributed approximately every six months. 

Health &#38; Wellness 

We are committed to promoting the health, safety and well-being of our employees, business partners and global communities. Lumen strives for an above-average safety performance as we continue our investments in programs and training to support health and safety. We want all of our employees to thrive, and we regularly re-evaluate how to best support our employees&#8217; well-being through benefits and resources. We design our current benefit and wellness programs to drive engagement that positively impacts our culture, job satisfaction, recruiting and retention programs. We offer progressive employee benefits and enhancements that recognize the diverse needs of our people and their families. 

Labor Relations 

At December 31, 2023, approximately 21% of our U.S. workforce was represented by a union, either the Communications Workers of America or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. A small number of our overseas employees are represented by unions or another representative body. We recognize the critical role that our supervisors and managers play in fostering a productive and respectful work environment, and we encourage employees to work directly with their supervisors, where possible, to efficiently and effectively resolve workplace concerns. We also respect our employees&#8217; rights to voluntarily establish and join unions and similar associations without unlawful interference. We strive to work collaboratively with the unions, councils and associations that represent our workers. 

Customer Success 

Our customers range from individual households to global enterprises. Whether our network supports remote education to under-served communities or a multi-national work-from-home enterprise, all customers are impacted by the quality and reliability of our products and services. Understanding how each customer accesses and uses our products and services informs the type of customer engagement to best meet their expectations. Lumen's Customer Experience ("CX") team takes the lead in driving customer obsession and guiding the company toward our North Star by listening and learning from our customers, then acting to meet their needs. This assists us in accomplishing our mission of igniting business growth by connecting people, data and applications - quickly, securely, and effortlessly. We believe a strong experience leads to satisfied customers and engaged employees who are encouraged to recommend creative solutions. 

We highly value both customer and employee suggestions. We offer our customers several channels for communicating with us, including voice, text, email, chat and social media, among others. We are driving a digital-first culture that allows our customers to configure, order and rapidly deploy our services through an all-digital, self-service set of tools. Since 2019, we have hosted an annual CX event, during which we invite customers to collaborate directly with us. 

While careful listening to customers is the best source of customer experience feedback, we believe overlaying it with employee feedback is the most effective way to continuously improve. We regularly invite our front-line employees to provide feedback on opportunities to improve our capabilities. 

Partners and Vendors 

We seek to engage with those partners and vendors who best contribute to our customers&#8217; success. Lumen seeks to co-innovate with a comprehensive group of strategic partners to create solutions focused exclusively on our customers' business and IT requirements. Through our open and interoperable approach, we seek to identify the optimal platform for serving our customers &#8211; whether ours or a third party&#8217;s. When necessary, Lumen incorporates market-leading technologies to optimize application performance and streamline integration throughout the IT stack to ensure seamless integration and interoperability. Lumen has collaborated with a host of technology partners, in an effort to integrate different technologies to improve our products and services. We believe this collaboration has strengthened our capability to tailor and manage scalable solutions that customers control. 

Given these efforts to better serve our customers, we are materially reliant on a wide range of vendors to support our organization and partners to support our strategy. We work with, and rely on, other communications companies that lease us transmission capacity or sell us various services necessary for our current operations, as well as a wide range of software, hardware and equipment suppliers. We believe that co-innovating with other companies enables us to more rapidly improve our customer offerings. 

In addition, we provide services to our customers in Latin America and EMEA through contractual relationships with third-party carriers. Under these arrangements, the third-party carriers invoice us for their services, and we pass along those charges to our customers through our invoices. 

Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability 

We believe our commitment to environmental sustainability promotes the financial health of our business and strengthens our relations with our employees, communities, customers and investors. 

In early 2022, we formed the Sustainability Management Committee (&#8220;SMC&#8221;) comprised of employees from across the business. The SMC designs and oversees our company-wide sustainability program, including the monitoring of climate-related issues, and is responsible for driving our sustainability agenda with the Board and senior leadership. Additionally, our Environment, Health and Safety ("EHS") team is responsible for overseeing and implementing our EHS and environmental sustainability initiatives. 

The EHS program framework focuses on the following key areas: 

&#8226; Environmental compliance and management: The Lumen EHS team assesses and reviews our company programs, operational facilities and waste management vendors. We monitor environmental legislative activity and collaborate with other internal groups to develop documented practices and procedures that support compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 

&#8226; Energy and emissions: In an effort to reduce our carbon footprint, we continue to identify and implement energy efficiency and greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions reduction initiatives. In November 2023, we announced early achievement of our 2018-2025 science-based GHG emissions-reduction targets. We remain committed to exploring ways to reduce GHG emissions through our operational, customer and employee initiatives. 

&#8226; Water: Lumen uses the World Resource Institute&#8217;s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas to assess susceptibility to future water stress across our areas of operation. We strive to reduce our water consumption, especially in the water-stressed communities where we operate. We track our usage and closely monitor abnormalities to improve water efficiencies and reduce site discharge. 

&#8226; Waste: We are committed to reusing and recycling products, minimizing material use and carefully managing our waste. Each year, we divert millions of pounds of electronic and communications equipment from landfills. We recycle telecommunications equipment, and our modem/router takeback program allows customers to return their equipment, which are then either reused or sent to an R2-certified recycler. 

&#8226; Supplier environmental assessment: We expect our suppliers to embrace and share our commitment to compliance and sustainability efforts. As reflected in our Supplier Code of Conduct, we expect our suppliers to use reasonable efforts to employ environmentally preferred and energy-efficient services, and to work with their own suppliers to assess and address environmental and sustainability issues within their supply chains. 

&#8226; Climate preparedness: We evaluate various climate change risks to our ongoing operations when we consider expanding our network or facilities. Our comprehensive business continuity program focuses on prevention, collaboration, communication, response and recovery to assist us in quickly resolving disruptive events. Weather events such as severe flooding and hurricanes can impact our ability to deliver services, so business resiliency and adaptability is key to the long-term viability of our business. 

&#8226; Occupational Health and Safety: The EHS team conducts risk assessments, reviews safety incident data and monitors health and safety legislation to develop policies and procedures designed to minimize safety hazards and support compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We continuously monitor safety performance to identify trends and evaluate opportunities to eliminate or reduce the risks of workplace hazards. 

Our Network 

Our network, through which we provide most of our products and services, consists of fiber-optic and copper cables, high-speed transport equipment, electronics, voice switches, data switches, routers, and various other equipment. We operate part of our network with leased assets, and a substantial portion of our equipment with licensed software. 

At December 31, 2023, our network (owned and leased) included (i) approximately 350,000 route miles of fiber optic plant and (ii) multiple gateway and transmission facilities used in connection with operating our network throughout North America. 

At December 31, 2023, our domestic network connected to (i) approximately 170,000 buildings, which we refer to as &#8220;Fiber On-net&#8221; buildings, serving our enterprise customer base and (ii) approximately 21.8 million broadband-enabled units capable of serving our Mass Markets customer base. At December 31, 2023, approximately 3.7 million of our Mass Markets broadband-enabled units were capable of receiving services from our fiber-based infrastructure, with the remainder connected with copper-based infrastructure. Our domestic network also included at such date central office and other equipment that enables us to provide telephone service as an ILEC. 

As discussed in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Item 7 of Part II of this report and Note 2&#8212;Divestitures of the Latin American, ILEC and EMEA Businesses to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report, we sold portions of our network during 2022 and 2023. 

As noted elsewhere in this report, we view our network as one of our most critical assets. We have devoted, and plan to continue to devote, substantial resources to (i) simplify and modernize our network and legacy systems (ii) retire aging or obsolete systems and plant and (iii) expand our network to address demand for enhanced or new products. A key element of our network expansion plan is our Quantum Fiber buildout project. Under this project, we propose over the next several years to construct additional fiber optic infrastructure to enable us to provide Quantum Fiber broadband services to several million additional urban and suburban locations in our remaining ILEC markets. 

Although we own most of our network, we lease a substantial portion of our core fiber network from several other communication companies under arrangements that will periodically need to be renewed or replaced to support our current network operations. 

As a critical infrastructure provider, we are a constant target of cyber-attacks from a wide range of intruders, including advanced persistent threat actors. From time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we experience security incidents and disruption in our services. We develop and maintain systems and programs designed to protect against cyber-attacks and network outages. The development, maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to bypass security measures become more sophisticated and evolve rapidly. 

For additional information regarding our systems, network assets, network risks, capital expenditure requirements and reliance upon third parties, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this report. 

Competition 

We compete in a dynamic and highly competitive market in which demand for high-speed, secure data services continues to grow. We expect continued intense competition from a wide variety of sources under these evolving market conditions. In addition to competition from large international communications providers, we are facing competition from a growing number of sources, including systems integrators, hyperscalers, cloud service providers, software networking companies, infrastructure companies, cable companies, wireless service providers, device providers, resellers and smaller niche providers. 

Our ability to compete hinges upon effectively enhancing and better integrating our existing products, introducing new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, meeting changing customer needs, providing high-quality information security to build customer confidence and combat cyber-attacks, extending our core technology into new applications and anticipating emerging technological and industry changes. Depending on the applicable market and services, competition can be intense, especially if competitors in the market have network assets better suited to customer needs, faster transmission speeds or lower prices, or, in certain overseas markets, are national or regional incumbent communications providers that have a longer history of providing service in the market. 

We compete to provide services to business customers based on a variety of factors, including the comprehensiveness and reliability of our network, our data transmission speeds, price, the latency of our available network services, the scope of our integrated offerings, the reach and peering capacity of our IP network, and customer service. Competition from large communications providers, systems integrators, hyperscalers and others have increased pricing pressures with respect to several key products and services that we offer to our enterprise and wholesale business customers. In particular, several hyperscalers have recently built their own data transmission facilities, which has reduced demand for our network services. 

Competition to provide broadband services to our mass markets customers remains high. Market demand for our broadband services could be adversely affected by (i) advanced wireless data transmission technologies, including fixed wireless and low-earth-orbit satellite services, and (ii) continued enhancements to cable-based services, each of which generally provides faster average broadband transmission speeds than our copper-based infrastructure. In addition, several established or new communications companies, infrastructure companies or municipalities have built or are building new fiber-based networks to provide high-speed broadband services in existing or unserved markets, frequently with the support of governmental subsidies. Our network expansion and innovation strategy is focused largely on addressing these competitive pressures. To meet these demands and remain competitive, we are continuing to invest in network capacity, security, reliability, flexibility and design innovations, including through our Quantum Fiber buildout initiative. 

For our traditional voice services, providers of wireless voice, social networking, videoconferencing and electronic messaging services are significant competitors as many customers are increasingly using these services to communicate, resulting in the long-term systemic decline in our traditional voice services. Other potential sources of competition include non-carrier systems that are capable of bypassing our local networks, either partially or completely, through various means. Developments in software have permitted new competitors to offer affordable networking products that historically required more expensive hardware investment. We anticipate that all these trends will continue to place downward pressures on the use of our voice network. 

Additionally, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 obligates ILECs, including those operated by us, to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the ILEC&#8217;s network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition, including obligations to (i) negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith, (ii) provide nondiscriminatory &#8220;unbundled&#8221; access to specific portions of the ILEC&#8217;s network and (iii) permit competitors to physically or virtually collocate their plant on the ILEC&#8217;s property. As a result of the above-described regulatory and technological developments, we also face competition from competitive local exchange carriers ("CLECs"), particularly in densely populated areas. CLECs provide competing services through (i) reselling an ILEC&#8217;s local services, (ii) using an ILEC&#8217;s unbundled network elements, (iii) operating their own facilities or (iv) a combination thereof. 

Additional information about competitive pressures is located under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Business Risks&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this report. 

Sales and Marketing 

Sales Channels 

Our enterprise sales and marketing approach focuses on solving complex customer problems with advanced technology and network solutions &#8211; striving to make core networks services compatible with digital tools. We also rely on our call center personnel and a variety of channel partners to promote sales of services that meet the needs of our customers. To meet the needs of different customers, our offerings include both stand-alone services and bundled services designed to provide a complete offering of integrated services. 

Our business customers range from small business offices to the world&#8217;s largest global enterprise customers. Our direct sales representatives generally market our business services to members of in-house IT departments or other highly-sophisticated customers with deep technological experience. These individuals typically satisfy their IT requirements by contracting with us or a rapidly evolving group of competitors, or by deploying in-house solutions. We also market our products and services through inbound call centers, telemarketing and third parties, including telecommunications agents, system integrators, value-added resellers and other telecommunications firms. We support our distribution through digital advertising, events, television advertising, website promotions and public relations. We maintain local offices in most major and secondary markets within the U.S. and many of the primary markets of the other countries in which we provide services. 

Similarly, our sales and marketing approach to our mass market customers emphasizes customer-oriented sales, marketing and service with a local presence. Our approach includes marketing our products and services primarily through direct sales representatives, inbound call centers, telemarketing and third parties, including retailers, satellite television providers, door to door sales agents and digital marketing firms. 

Segments and Products &#38; Services 

We structure our segments and customer-facing sales channels to align with how we support our customers. We believe this reporting structure provides greater transparency into how we are performing against our strategy, including focusing on growth opportunities and managing declining legacy services. 

Segments 

We report our financial performance using two segments, as described below: 

&#8226; Business Segment: Under our Business segment, we provide our products and services under four sales channels to meet the needs of our enterprise and commercial customers; and 

&#8226; Mass Markets Segment: Under our Mass Markets segment, we provide products and services to residential and small business customers. 

The following table shows the composition of our operating revenue by segment for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021: 

##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, Percent Change &#160; 2023 2022 2021 2023 vs 2022 2022 vs 2021 Percentage of revenue: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Business 79 % 75 % 72 % 4 % 3 % Mass Markets 21 % 25 % 28 % (4) % (3) % Total operating revenue 100 % 100 % 100 % &#160; ##TABLE_END

&#8226; Fiber Broadband , under which we provide high speed broadband services to residential and small business customers utilizing our fiber-based network infrastructure; 

&#8226; Other Broadband , under which we provide primarily lower speed broadband services to residential and small business customers utilizing our copper-based network infrastructure; and 

&#8226; Voice and Other, under which we derive revenues from (i) providing local and long-distance voice services, professional services, and other ancillary services, and (ii) federal broadband and state support programs. 

Research, Development &#38; Intellectual Property 

As of December 31, 2023, we held approximately 3,100 patents and patent applications in the U.S. and other countries. We have also received licenses to use patents held by others, which give us the freedom to operate our business without the risk of interruption from the holder of the patented technology. We plan to continue to file new patent applications as we enhance and develop products and services, and we plan to continue to seek opportunities to expand our patent portfolio through strategic acquisitions and licensing. 

In addition to our patent rights, we have rights in various trade names, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property that we use to conduct our business. Our services often use the intellectual property of others, including licensed software. We also occasionally license our intellectual property to others as we deem appropriate. 

For information on various litigation risks associated with owning and using intellectual property rights, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Business Risks&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this report, and Note 18&#8212;Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report. 

Regulation of Our Business 

Our domestic operations are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC"), by various state regulatory commissions and occasionally by local agencies. Our non-domestic operations are regulated by supranational groups (such as the European Union, or EU), national agencies and frequently state, provincial or local bodies. Generally, we must obtain and maintain operating licenses from these bodies in most areas where we offer regulated services. 

Changes in the composition and leadership of the FCC, state regulatory commissions and other agencies that regulate our business could have significant impacts on our revenue, expenses, competitive position and prospects. Changes in the composition and leadership of these agencies are often difficult to predict, which makes future planning more difficult. 

The following description discusses some of the major regulations affecting our operations, but others could have a substantial impact on us as well. For additional information, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this report. 

Federal Regulation of Domestic Operations 

General 

The FCC regulates the interstate services we provide, including the business data service charges we bill for wholesale network transmission and intercarrier compensation, including the interstate access charges that we bill other communications companies in connection with the origination and termination of interstate phone calls. Additionally, the FCC regulates several aspects of our business related to international communications services, privacy, public safety and network infrastructure, including (i) our access to and use of local telephone numbers, (ii) our provision of emergency 911 services and (iii) our use or removal (potentially on a reimbursable basis) of equipment produced by certain vendors deemed to cause potential national security risks. We could incur substantial penalties if we fail to comply with the FCC&#8217;s applicable regulations. 

Many of the FCC&#8217;s regulations adopted in recent years remain subject to judicial review and additional rule-makings, thus increasing the difficulty of determining the ultimate impact of these changes on us and our competitors. 

Universal Service 

Between 2015 and 2021, we received approximately $500 million annually through Phase II of the FCC's Connect America Fund ("CAF II"), a program that ended on December 31, 2021. In connection with the CAF II funding, we were required to meet certain specified infrastructure buildout requirements in 33 states by the end of 2021, which required substantial capital expenditures. In the first quarter of 2022, we recognized $59 million of previously deferred revenue related to the conclusion of the CAF II program based upon our final buildout and filing submissions. The government has the right to audit our compliance with the CAF II program. The ultimate outcome of any remaining examinations is unknown, but could result in a liability to us in excess of our reserve accruals established for these matters. 

In January 2020, the FCC created the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (&#8220;RDOF&#8221;) program, a federal support program designed to fund broadband deployment in rural America. For the first phase of this program, RDOF Phase I, the FCC ultimately awarded $6.4 billion in support payments to be paid in equal monthly installments over 10 years. We were awarded RDOF funding in several of the states in which we operate and began receiving monthly support payments during the second quarter of 2022. We received approximately $17 million in annual RDOF Phase I support payments for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and expect to receive this same amount each year thereafter during the program period. 

Federal officials have proposed changes to current programs and laws that could impact us, including proposals designed to increase broadband access, increase competition among broadband providers, lower broadband costs and re-adopt "net neutrality" rules similar to those adopted under a prior administration. In late 2021, the U.S. Congress enacted legislation that appropriated $65 billion to improve broadband affordability and access, primarily through federally funded state grants. As of the date of this report, various state and federal agencies are continuing to take steps to make this funding available to eligible applicants, including us. Although it remains premature to speculate on the ultimate impact of this legislation on us, we anticipate that the release of this funding would increase competition for broadband customers in newly-served areas. 

For additional information about these programs, see (i) Note 4&#8212;Revenue Recognition to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report and (ii) "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of Part II of this report. 

Broadband Regulation 

In February 2015, the FCC adopted an order regulating broadband internet access services (&#8220;BIAS&#8221;) as a Title II utility service under the Communications Act of 1934. In December 2017, the FCC voted to repeal the classification of BIAS as a Title II utility service and to preempt states from imposing substantial regulations on broadband services. Opponents of this change appealed this action in federal court. Several states have also opposed the change and have proposed, implemented or enacted laws or orders focused on state-specific Internet service regulation. In October 2019, the federal court upheld the FCC&#8217;s classification decision but vacated a part of its preemption ruling. Various courts are considering or have ruled upon the issue of the enforceability of state broadband regulation, and additional litigation and appeals are expected with respect to this issue. In addition, members of the current administration and various consumer interest groups have advocated in favor of reclassifying BIAS as a Title II utility service. The ultimate impact of these pending judicial matters and calls for additional regulation are currently unknown to us, although the imposition of heightened regulation of our Internet operations could potentially hamper our ability to operate our data networks efficiently, restrict our ability to implement network management practices necessary to ensure quality service, increase the cost of operating, maintaining and upgrading our network, and otherwise negatively impact our current operations. 

State Regulation of Domestic Operations 

Historically ILECs, including ours, have been regulated as &#8220;common carriers,&#8221; and state regulatory commissions have generally exercised jurisdiction over intrastate voice telecommunications services and their associated facilities. In recent years, most states have reduced their regulation of ILECs. State regulatory commissions generally continue to (i) set the rates that telecommunications companies charge each other for exchanging traffic, (ii) administer support programs designed to subsidize the provision of services to high-cost rural areas, (iii) regulate the purchase and sale of ILECs, (iv) require ILECs to provide service under publicly-filed tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices of regulated services, (v) limit ILECs&#8217; ability to borrow and pledge their assets, (vi) regulate transactions between ILECs and their affiliates and (vii) impose various other service standards. 

In most states, switched and business data services and interconnection services are subject to price regulation, although the extent of regulation varies by type of service and geographic region. In addition, Voice-Over-Internet Protocol services are regulated by state regulators, but more lightly than ILEC services. State agencies also regulate certain aspects of non-ILEC communications businesses, including administering the payment of federal subsidies to support broadband infrastructure construction. 

Data Privacy Laws and Regulations 

Various foreign, federal and state laws govern our storage, maintenance and use of customer data, including a wide range of consumer protection, data protection, privacy, intellectual property and similar laws. Data privacy regulations are complex and vary across jurisdictions. As a company providing global services, we must comply with various jurisdictional data privacy regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) in the EU and similar laws adopted by various other jurisdictions in certain of our domestic and overseas markets. Domestically, the number of state privacy laws continues to increase. The application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws are often uncertain, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. These regulations require careful handling of personal and customer data and could have a significant impact on our business, especially if we violate any of those regulations. 

Anti-Bribery and Corruption Regulations 

As a provider of global services, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations governing business ethics and practices, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anti-competition regulations. We have compliance policies, programs and training designed to prevent non-compliance with such anti-corruption regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. 

Regulation of International Operations 

Our subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. are subject to various regulations in the markets where service is provided. The scope of regulation varies from country to country. The communications regulatory regimes in certain of our non-domestic markets are in the process of development. Many issues, including the pricing of services, have not been addressed fully, or even at all. 

Our overseas operations are also subject to various other domestic or non-domestic laws or regulations, including various laws or regulations governing exports and imports of various goods or technologies and certain sanctioned business activities. 

In 2020, the United Kingdom (&#8220;UK&#8221;) terminated its membership in the EU (&#8220;Brexit&#8221;) and has entered into related separation agreements with the EU regarding data sharing, financial services and other matters. Following the sale of our EMEA operations on November 1, 2023, we conduct only limited operations within the UK and EU. Consequently, we do not anticipate Brexit will have a substantial impact on our business. 

Other Regulations 

Our networks and properties are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations governing the use, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, the release of pollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination. Our contingent liabilities under these laws are further described in Note 18&#8212;Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items. Certain federal and state agencies, including attorneys general, monitor and exercise oversight related to consumer protection issues. We are also subject to codes that regulate our trenching and construction operations or that require us to obtain permits, licenses or franchises to operate. Such regulations are enacted by municipalities, counties, state, federal or other regional governmental bodies, and can vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as a result. Such regulations may also require us to pay substantial fees. 

Seasonality 

Overall, our business is not materially impacted by seasonality. Our network-related operating expenses are, however, generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year. From time to time, weather related problems have resulted in increased costs to repair our network and respond to service calls in some of our markets. The amount and timing of these costs are subject to the weather patterns of any given year but have generally been highest during the third quarter and have been related to damage from severe storms, including hurricanes, tropical storms and tornadoes in our markets along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastlines. 

Additional Information 

From time to time, we may make investments in other communications or technology companies. For further information on regulatory, technological and competitive factors that could impact our revenue, see "Regulation" and "Competition" above under this Item 1 and "Risk Factors" below under Item 1A. For more information on the financial contributions of our various services, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of Part II of this report.
