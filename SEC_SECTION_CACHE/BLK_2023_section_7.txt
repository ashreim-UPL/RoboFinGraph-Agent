Overview 

BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, &#8220;BlackRock&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $8.6 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2022. With approximately 19,800 employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients in more than 100 countries across the globe. For further information see Note 1, Business Overview , and Note 27, Segment Information , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8. 

The following discussion includes a comparison of BlackRock&#8217;s results for 2022 and 2021. For a discussion of BlackRock&#8217;s results for 2020 and a comparison of results for 2021 and 2020, see Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was filed with the SEC on February 25, 2022. 

Certain prior period presentations and disclosures, while not required to be recast, were reclassified to ensure comparability with current period classifications. 

Business Outlook 

BlackRock&#8217;s strategy continues to be guided by the Company's clients' needs and focus on the long-term, which the Company believes better enables it to deliver durable returns for shareholders and create value for all of its stakeholders. 

BlackRock's framework for long-term shareholder value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth, leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time, and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis. BlackRock's diversified platform, in terms of style, product, client and geography, enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning BlackRock to invest for the long-term by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management. 

BlackRock&#8217;s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees earned as a percentage of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees, which are normally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, and BlackRock&#8217;s ability to maintain strong investment performance, could impact BlackRock&#8217;s AUM, revenue and earnings. 

During 2022, BlackRock voluntarily waived a portion of its management fees on certain money market funds to ensure that they maintained a minimum level of daily net investment income. These waivers resulted in a reduction of management fees of approximately $72 million in 2022, a portion of which was partially offset by a reduction of BlackRock&#8217;s distribution and servicing costs paid to financial intermediaries. 

&#160; 

Approximately 50% of these gross fee waivers are generally shared with distributors, reducing the impact on operating income. These waivers ceased following rate hikes by the Bank of England and the United States (&#34;US&#34;) Federal Reserve in March 2022. 

Recently, central banks globally have raised interest rates in an effort to moderate inflation. BlackRock&#8217;s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates. Changes in global interest rates may cause BlackRock&#8217;s AUM to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company&#8217;s base fees, net income and operating cash flows. BlackRock&#8217;s business may also be impacted by governmental changes, as well as potential regulations, foreign and trade policies and fiscal spending that may arise as a result of such changes. See Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors herein for information on the possible future effects of changes in global interest rates and governmental changes on the Company's results. 

BlackRock manages $2.5 trillion in fixed income assets, nearly two-thirds of which are owned by institutions for strategic or liability-matching purposes. BlackRock believes it is well positioned for a higher rate environment due to the breadth, diversification and investment performance of its fixed income platform which encompasses active, exchange-traded funds (&#34;ETFs&#34;) and non-ETF index fixed income products, and a range of strategies, including unconstrained, high yield, total return and short-duration. 

BlackRock manages $4.4 trillion of equity assets across markets globally. Beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUM weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock&#8217;s effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AUM and investment advisory and administration fees (collectively &#8220;base fees&#8221;) and securities lending revenue. 

BlackRock&#8217;s highly diversified multi-product platform was created to meet client needs in all market environments and provide clients with choice in how they seek to achieve their unique financial goals. BlackRock is positioned to provide alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes and geographies. In addition, BlackRock leverages its world-class risk management, analytics and technology capabilities, including the Aladdin platform, on behalf of clients. BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, as well as investors in ETFs, maintaining differentiated client relationships and a fiduciary focus. The diversity of BlackRock&#8217;s platform facilitates the generation of organic growth in various market environments, and as client preferences evolve. BlackRock&#8217;s long-term strategy remains to keep alpha at the heart of BlackRock; accelerate growth in ETFs, illiquid alternatives, and technology; deliver whole portfolio solutions and become the global leader in sustainable investing. 

BlackRock is a $2.3 trillion active manager, with the active platform reflecting global reach, interconnectivity across teams and regions, growing data and insights, integrated technology and risk management and scalable processes &#8211; all of which the Company believes enables it to deliver more consistent outcomes for clients over the long-term. 

The index investing industry has been growing rapidly &#8211; with ETFs as a major beneficiary &#8211; driven by structural tailwinds including the migration from commission-based to fee-based wealth management, growth in model portfolios, clients&#8217; focus on value for money, the use of ETFs as alpha tools and the modernization of the bond market. BlackRock&#8217;s ETF growth strategy is centered on increasing scale and pursuing global growth themes in client and product segments, including Core, Strategic, which includes Fixed Income, Factors, Sustainable and Thematic ETFs, and Precision Exposures. 

Clients are also increasing their allocations to private markets as they search for diversification and higher returns. BlackRock has built a broad illiquid alternatives platform with $118 billion of AUM across infrastructure, private credit, real estate and private equity to meet this demand. As of December 31, 2022, BlackRock has approximately $34 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternatives strategies, and remains confident in its ability to accelerate growth as a leader in private markets. BlackRock also manages $81 billion in liquid alternatives, as well as $86 billion in liquid credit strategies, included within fixed income AUM. 

BlackRock continues to invest in technology services offerings, which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk, effectively serve clients and operate efficiently. Anticipated industry consolidation and regulatory requirements should continue to drive demand for holistic and flexible technology solutions. BlackRock continues to evolve and enable clients to further simplify their operating infrastructure with Aladdin. Clients increasingly want to tailor how they use Aladdin to meet their specific needs, and BlackRock is providing them with choice and flexibility. BlackRock is creating connectivity with ecosystem providers and third-party technology solutions, which include asset servicers, cloud providers, digital asset platforms, trading systems and others, who can work with clients in their Aladdin environments to provide a more customized and seamless end-to-end experience. BlackRock is also investing to scale Aladdin for its next leg of growth through the substantially complete migration of Aladdin from BlackRock-hosted data centers to the cloud. This is expected to bring enhanced capabilities to BlackRock and its Aladdin clients, accelerating innovation and supporting greater computing scale and flexibility for clients. Through this migration as well as BlackRock&#8217;s strategic partnership with Snowflake, an industry-leader in cloud enabled data technology, the Company is building Aladdin Data Cloud, a next generation solution that brings Aladdin and non-Aladdin data together, so clients can nimbly access and use data across their organization unlocking their full potential for collaboration, creativity, and innovation. 

As the asset management landscape shifts globally from individual product selection to a whole-portfolio approach, BlackRock&#8217;s strategy is focused on creating outcome-oriented client solutions for both retail investors and institutions. This includes having a diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and alternative products, as well as enhanced distribution and portfolio construction technology offerings. Digital wealth tools are an important component of BlackRock&#8217;s retail strategy, as BlackRock scales and customizes model portfolios, extends Aladdin Wealth and digital wealth partnerships globally, and helps advisors build better portfolios through portfolio construction and risk management, powered by Aladdin . BlackRock has seen strong momentum in outsourcing solutions among institutional clients, including the funding of several significant mandates in 2022, and anticipates continued outsourcing opportunities in the future. 

Across BlackRock, many clients are focusing on the impact of sustainability factors on their portfolios. This shift has been driven by an increased understanding of how sustainability-related factors can affect economic growth, asset values, and financial markets as a whole. As a fiduciary, BlackRock is committed to providing clients with choice and then executing in accordance with their chosen objectives. BlackRock's longstanding model of choice helps clients build portfolios to match the preferences and goals unique to each of them &#8211; for some clients this includes investing in sustainable strategies. 

BlackRock believes its strategy aligns with expected future client demand for attractive yields in fixed income, outsourcing solutions, ETFs, private markets and Aladdin technology, which it expects will continue to shape growth opportunities going forward.

##TABLE_END &#160; 

(1) As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures . Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, BlackRock updated the definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include new adjustments. Such measures have been recast for 2021 to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. For further information, refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures or the Current Report on Form 8-K furnished on April 13, 2022. 

(2) Total BlackRock stockholders&#8217; equity, divided by total shares outstanding at December 31 of the respective year-end. 

2022 Compared w ith 2021 

GAAP. Operating income of $6.4 billion decreased $1.1 billion and operating margin of 35.7% decreased 280 bps from 2021. Decreases in operating income and operating margin reflected lower base fees, driven by the negative impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements, and lower performance fees, partially offset by lower expense, including lower compensation and benefits expense and the impact of $274 million of product launch costs incurred in 2021. Operating income for 2022 also included a restructuring charge of $91 million from an initiative to modify the size and shape of the workforce to align more closely with strategic priorities. 

Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (&#34;NCI&#34;) decreased $330 million from 2021, driven primarily by mark-to-market losses on the Company&#8217;s un-hedged seed capital and co-investment portfolios, partially offset by higher noncash gains related to our strategic minority investment in iCapital Network, Inc. (&#34;iCapital&#34;) in 2022. 

Income tax expense for 2022 reflected $235 million of net discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2022 and the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters, and $35 million of net noncash tax benefits related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities. Income tax expense for 2021 included $126 million of noncash net expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom (&#34;UK&#34;) increasing its corporate tax rate and state and local income tax changes. Income tax expense for 2021 also included a $43 million discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation awards. 

Diluted earnings per common share decreased $4.25, or 11%, from 2021, reflecting lower operating and nonoperating income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate in 2022. 

As Adjusted . Operating income of $6.7 billion decreased $1.0 billion and operating margin of 42.8% decreased 400 bps from 2021. The pre-tax restructuring charge of $91 million described above has been excluded from as adjusted results for 2022. The impact of product launch costs described above has been excluded from as adjusted operating margin for 2022 and 2021. 

Diluted earnings per common share decreased $5.15, or 13%, from 2021, reflecting lower operating and nonoperating income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate in 2022. Income tax expense for 2022 and 2021 excluded the $35 million noncash net benefit and the $126 million noncash net expense, respectively, described above. 

Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, BlackRock updated the definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include new adjustments. Such measures have been recast for 2021 to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). 

For further discussion of BlackRock&#8217;s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein. 

&#160; 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, management believes evaluating the Company&#8217;s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (&#8220;non-GAAP adjustments&#8221;) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock&#8217;s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock&#8217;s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance comparability for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock&#8217;s revenue and expense. BlackRock&#8217;s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 

Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the Company updated its definition of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions. Such measures have been recast for the periods presented herein to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. 

Computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows:

##TABLE_END Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock&#8217;s financial performance over time, and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company&#8217;s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company&#8217;s financial performance, to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company&#8217;s senior-level employees and to evaluate the Company&#8217;s relative performance against industry peers. Furthermore, this metric eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers. 

&#8226; Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, the Company updated its definition of operating income, as adjusted, to include adjustments related to amortization of intangible assets, other acquisition-related costs, including compensation costs for nonrecurring retention-related deferred compensation, and contingent consideration fair value adjustments incurred in connection with certain acquisitions. Management believes excluding the impact of these expenses when calculating operating income, as adjusted, provides a helpful indication of the Company&#8217;s financial performance over time, thereby providing helpful information for both management and investors while also increasing comparability with other companies. In 2022, the Company recorded a restructuring charge primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards in connection with an initiative to modify the size and shape of the workforce to align more closely with strategic priorities. In addition, the Company recorded an expense related to the lease of office space for its new headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York (&#8220;Lease cost &#8211; Hudson Yards&#8221;) from August 2021, when it obtained access to the building to begin its tenant improvements. The Company will begin cash lease payments related to the new headquarters in May 2023. As a result, the Company is recognizing lease expense for both its current and new headquarters until its current headquarters lease expires in April 2023. Management believes excluding the impact of the restructuring charge and Lease cost &#8211; Hudson Yards when calculating operating income, as adjusted, is useful to assess the Company&#8217;s financial performance, ongoing operations, and enhances comparability among periods presented. For further information on non-GAAP expense adjustments related to BlackRock's (1) 2020 charitable contribution and (2) 2018 restructuring charge and PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (&#34;PNC&#34;) long-term incentive plans funding obligation refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2018, respectively, which were filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021, and February 28, 2019, respectively. 

&#8226; Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock&#8217;s results until future periods. 

&#160; 

&#8226; Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company&#8217;s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries.

##TABLE_END &#160; 

(1) Non-GAAP adjustments are net of tax excluding income tax matters. 

Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock&#8217;s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock&#8217;s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. 

For each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustments were tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. Amounts for income tax matters represent net noncash (benefit) expense primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill as a result of tax rate changes. Amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. The amounts for 2022 income tax matters included net noncash expense related to state and local income tax changes. The amounts for 2021 and 2020 income tax matters included net noncash expense related to the impact of legislation enacted in the UK increasing its corporate tax rate and state and local income tax changes. These amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. 

See note (1) above regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the updated presentation of non-GAAP expense adjustments. 

Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding. 

(3) Annual Contract Value (&#34;ACV&#34;): Management believes ACV is an effective metric for reviewing BlackRock&#8217;s technology services&#8217; ongoing contribution to its operating results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods while also providing a useful supplemental metric for both management and investors of BlackRock&#8217;s growth in technology services revenue over time, as it is linked to the net new business in technology services. ACV represents forward-looking, annualized estimated value of the recurring subscription fees under client contracts, assuming all client contracts that come up for renewal are renewed, unless we received a notice of termination, even though such notice may not be effective until a later date. ACV also includes the annualized estimated value of new sales, for existing and new clients, when we execute client contracts, even though the recurring fees may not be effective until a later date and excludes nonrecurring fees such as implementation and consulting fees. 

&#160; 

Assets Under Management 

AUM for reporting purposes generally is based upon how investment advisory and administration fees are calculated for each portfolio. Net asset values, total assets, committed assets or other measures may be used to determine portfolio AUM.

##TABLE_END &#160; 

&#160; 

(1) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes. 

(2) Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing thirteen months. 

(3) Amounts include commodity ETFs. 

AUM decreased $1.4 trillion to $8.6 trillion at December 31, 2022 from $10.0 trillion at December 31, 2021 driven by net market depreciation and the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by positive net inflows, led by flows into bond ETFs, significant outsourcing mandates and growth in private markets. 

Net market depreciation of $1.5 trillion was primarily driven by global equity and fixed income market depreciation. 

AUM decreased $220 billion due to the negative impact of foreign exchange movements, due to the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Euro. 

For further discussion on AUM, see Part I, Item 1 &#8211; Business &#8211; Assets Under Management .

##TABLE_END &#160; 

&#160; 

(1) Amounts include AUM attributable to the Aperio Transaction. 

(2) Foreign exchange reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes. 

(3) Average AUM is calculated as the average of the month-end spot AUM amounts for the trailing thirteen months. 

(4) Advisory AUM represents long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. 

(5) Amounts include commodity ETFs. 

AUM increased $1.3 trillion to $10.0 trillion at December 31, 2021 from $8.7 trillion at December 31, 2020 driven primarily by net market appreciation, positive net flows across all investment styles and product types, and AUM added from the Aperio Transaction, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange movements. 

Net market appreciation of $864 billion was driven primarily by higher global equity markets. 

AUM decreased $112 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the Euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound.

Discussion of Financial Results 

Introduction 

The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the Company. Fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of AUM and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. Such fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes. 

The Company also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed. 

Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of the Company&#8217;s revenue and earnings. The magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on illiquid alternative products and a greater number and size of liquid products with performance measurement periods that end in the third and fourth quarters. 

The Company offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools, all on a fee basis. Clients include banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, retail distributors and other investors. Fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed over time and are generally determined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform, or on a fixed-rate basis. Revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights. 

The Company earns distribution and service fees for distributing investment products and providing support services to investment portfolios. The fees are based on AUM and are recognized when the amount of fees is known. 

The Company advises global financial institutions, regulators, and government entities across a range of risk, regulatory, capital markets and strategic services. Fees earned for advisory services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are determined using fixed-rate fees and are recognized over time as the related services are completed. 

The Company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions recognized in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are recorded on a trade-date basis as transactions occur. 

The Company also earns revenue related to certain minority investments accounted for as equity method investments. 

Operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expense, general and administration expense and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. 

&#8226; Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs. 

&#8226; Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments to third parties, primarily associated with distribution and servicing of client investments in certain Company products. 

&#8226; Direct fund expense primarily consists of third-party nonadvisory expenses incurred by the Company related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expense, and audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expenses directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business. 

&#8226; General and administration expense includes marketing and promotional (including travel and entertainment expense), occupancy and office-related, portfolio services (including clearing expense related to transition management services, and market data costs), sub-advisory, technology, professional services, communications, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, product launch costs, the net impact of foreign currency remeasurement, and other general and administration expense. 

Approximately 80% of the Company&#8217;s revenue is generated in US dollars. The Company&#8217;s revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and British pound) are impacted by foreign exchange rates. Any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the Company&#8217;s considerable non-dollar expense base related to its operations outside the US. 

Nonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. The Company primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds and real assets. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. The Company does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients. 

In addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment products (&#8220;CIPs&#8221;). The portion of nonoperating income (expense) not attributable to the Company is allocated to NCI on the consolidated statements of income.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Revenue decreased $1.5 billion, or 8%, from 2021, largely driven by the negative impact of market beta and US dollar appreciation on average AUM and lower performance fees. 

Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $14.5 billion in 2022 decreased $809 million from $15.3 billion in 2021, primarily driven by the negative impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, partially offset by organic base fee growth, the elimination of yield-related fee waivers on money market funds, and higher securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue of $599 million increased $44 million from $555 million in 2021, primarily reflecting higher spreads. 

Investment advisory performance fees of $514 million in 2022 decreased $629 million from $1.1 billion in 2021, reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternative and long-only products, partially offset by higher revenue from illiquid alternative products. 

Technology services revenue of $1.4 billion for 2022 increased $83 million from $1.3 billion in 2021, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin , despite the negative impact of foreign exchange movements and market declines on Aladdin&#8217;s fixed income platform assets. Approximately 25% of Aladdin&#8217;s 2022 revenue was denominated in non-US currencies.

##TABLE_END Expense decreased $436 million, or 4%, from 2021, reflecting lower employee compensation and benefits expense, direct fund expense, and general and administration expense, including the impact of product launch costs incurred in 2021, partially offset by the impact of a $91 million restructuring charge recorded in 2022. 

Employee compensation and benefits expense decreased $362 million from 2021, reflecting lower incentive compensation due to lower operating income, performance fees and deferred compensation driven in part by the lower mark-to-market impact of certain deferred cash compensation programs, partially offset by higher base compensation. 

Direct fund expense decreased $87 million from 2021, reflecting lower average AUM. 

General and administration expense decreased $61 million from 2021, primarily driven by $274 million of product launch costs incurred in 2021, lower contingent consideration fair value adjustments in 2022 and lower sub-advisory expense, partially offset by higher marketing and promotional expense, including the impact from higher travel and entertainment expense, and higher technology expense. General and administration expense also reflected higher occupancy and office related expense, including higher noncash occupancy expense related to the lease of office space the Company recorded for its new headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York (&#8220;Lease cost &#8211; Hudson Yards&#8221;). The Company will begin lease payments related to the new headquarters in May 2023. As a result, the Company is recognizing lease expense for both its current and new headquarters until its current lease expires in April 2023. Lease cost &#8211; Hudson Yards has been excluded from our &#8220;as adjusted&#8221; financial results. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items. 

Restructuring charge of $91 million, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards, was recorded in 2022 in connection with an initiative to modify the size and shape of the workforce to align more closely with strategic priorities. The restructuring charge has been excluded from our &#34;as adjusted&#34; financial results. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items.

##TABLE_END &#160; 

&#160; 

(1) As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, BlackRock updated the definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include new adjustments. Such measures have been recast for 2021 to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. For further information, refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 

(2) Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI. 

The Company&#8217;s tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the Company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. The significant foreign jurisdictions that have different statutory tax rates than the US federal statutory rate of 21% include the UK, Canada, Switzerland and Germany. 

2022 Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected: 

&#8226; a discrete tax benefit of $148 million, primarily related to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters; 

&#8226; a discrete tax benefit of $87 million, related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2022; and 

&#8226; a discrete tax benefit of $35 million associated with the net noncash tax benefit related to the revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities. 

The as adjusted effective tax rate of 20.7% for 2022 excluded the $35 million net noncash benefit mentioned above as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. 

On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (&#34;IRA&#34;) was enacted into law, which introduced new provisions including a corporate book minimum tax and an excise tax on net stock repurchases which became effective on January 1, 2023. BlackRock does not expect the IRA to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

2021 Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected: 

&#8226; a $126 million net noncash expense associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets and liabilities related to legislation enacted in the UK increasing its corporate tax rate and state and local income tax changes; and 

&#8226; a discrete tax benefit of $43 million, related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2021. 

The as adjusted effective tax rate of 23.4% for 2021 excluded the $126 million net noncash expense mentioned above as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. 

&#160; 

Statement of financial condition Overview 

The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and CIPs. 

The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or NCI that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders&#8217; equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company&#8217;s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements 

Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the UK, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company&#8217;s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients. 

In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral obtained under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements for which it has legal title as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company&#8217;s assets. 

Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products 

The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) and voting rights entities (&#8220;VREs&#8221;), (collectively, &#8220;CIPs&#8221;). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on the Company&#8217;s consolidation policy. 

The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by CIPs to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by CIPs in order to obtain cash for use in the Company&#8217;s operations.

(1) Amounts represent segregated client assets and related liabilities, in which BlackRock has no economic interest. BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients. 

(2) Amounts represent the impact of consolidating CIPs. 

(3) Amount includes property and equipment and other assets. 

(4) Amount includes approximately $4.3 billion of deferred income tax liabilities related to goodwill and intangibles. See Note 25, Income Taxes , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information. 

&#160; 

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity. 

Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2022 and 2021 included $265 million and $308 million, respectively, of cash held by CIPs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2022). Accounts receivable at December 31, 2022 decreased $525 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower base and performance fee receivables. Investments, including the impact of CIPs increased $204 million from December 31, 2021 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets decreased $161 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to amortization of intangible assets. Other assets increased $950 million from December 31, 2021, primarily related to an increase in certain corporate minority investments and property and equipment, partially offset by lower unit trust receivables (substantially offset by a decrease in unit trust payables recorded within other liabilities). 

Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2022 decreased $679 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower 2022 incentive compensation accruals. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2022 decreased $103 million from December 31, 2021. Borrowings at December 31, 2022 decreased $792 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to repayments of $750 million. Other liabilities at December 31, 2022 decreased $448 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in uncertain tax positions and lower unit trust payables (substantially offset by a decrease in unit trust receivables recorded within other assets). Net deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2022 increased $623 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to the effect of temporary differences associated with capitalized costs. 

Investments 

The Company&#8217;s investments were $7.5 billion and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Investments include CIPs accounted for as VIEs and VREs. Management reviews BlackRock&#8217;s investments on an &#8220;economic&#8221; basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock&#8217;s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock&#8217;s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 

The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock. 

The Company further presents net &#8220;economic&#8221; investment exposure, net of hedged exposures, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The impact of certain investments is mitigated by derivatives including total return swaps and futures. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock&#8217;s stockholders&#8217; equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company&#8217;s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company&#8217;s net economic investment exposure.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of CIPs 

The consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the CIPs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of CIPs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the CIPs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock&#8217;s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP. 

The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of CIPs:

##TABLE_END Sources of BlackRock&#8217;s operating cash primarily include base fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock&#8217;s capital stock, repurchases of the Company&#8217;s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments. 

For details of the Company&#8217;s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. 

Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, primarily include the receipt of base fees, securities lending revenue, performance fees and technology services revenue, offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive and deferred compensation accrued during prior years, and income tax payments. 

Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for 2022 were $1.2 billion and primarily reflected $744 million of net investment purchases and $533 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $70 million of distributions of capital from equity method investees. 

Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for 2022 were $6.0 billion, primarily resulting from $3.0 billion of cash dividend payments, $2.3 billion of share repurchases, including $1.9 billion in open market transactions and $0.4 billion of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $0.8 billion of repayments of borrowings. 

&#160; 

The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Management believes that the Company&#8217;s liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under the Company&#8217;s existing revolving credit facility and uncommitted commercial paper private placement program, provide sufficient resources to meet the Company&#8217;s short-term and long-term cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. Liquidity resources at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:

(1) The Company cannot readily access such cash and cash equivalents to use in its operating activities. 

(2) The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company&#8217;s US subsidiaries was approximately 50% at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. See Net Capital Requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries. 

Total liquidity resources decreased $1.6 billion during 2022, primarily reflecting cash dividend payments of $3.0 billion, share repurchases of $2.3 billion and $0.8 billion of repayments of borrowings, partially offset by cash flows from other operating activities and a $0.3 billion increase in the aggregate commitment amount under the credit facility. 

A significant portion of the Company&#8217;s $6.4 billion of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash. 

Share Repurchases. During 2022, the Company repurchased 2.7 million common shares under the Company&#8217;s existing share repurchase program for approximately $1.9 billion. At December 31, 2022, there were approximately 0.9 million shares still authorized to be repurchased under the program. 

In January 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional seven million shares under the Company&#8217;s existing share repurchase program for a total of up to approximately 7.9 million shares of BlackRock common stock. 

Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers. 

BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (&#8220;BTC&#8221;) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. 

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company was required to maintain approximately $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the UK, and the Company&#8217;s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements. 

Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries. As a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings, US income taxes were provided on the Company&#8217;s undistributed foreign earnings. The financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its foreign subsidiaries remains indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The Company will continue to evaluate its capital management plans. 

Short-Term Borrowings 

2022 Revolving Credit Facility. The Company maintains an unsecured revolving credit facility which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes (the &#8220;2022 credit facility&#8221;). In March 2022, the 2022 credit facility was amended to, among other things, (1) increase the aggregate commitment amount by $300 million to $4.7 billion, (2) extend the maturity date to March 2027, (3) change the rate for borrowings denominated in US dollars from a rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) to a rate based on the secured overnight financing rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) subject to certain adjustments and (4) modify certain specified targets for the sustainability-linked pricing mechanics. The 2022 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, which could increase the overall size of the 2022 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount of up to $5.7 billion. The 2022 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2022 credit facility. 

Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the &#8220;CP Notes&#8221;) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2022 credit facility. At December 31, 2022, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding.

(1) The carrying value of the 1.25% Notes is calculated using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of December 31, 2022. 

In June 2022, the Company fully repaid $750 million of 3.375% notes at maturity. 

For more information on Company&#8217;s borrowings, see Note 15, Borrowings , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. 

Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies 

The Company&#8217;s material contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies at December 31, 2022 include borrowings, operating leases, investment commitments, compensation and benefits obligations, and purchase obligations. 

Borrowings . At December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding borrowings with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $6.7 billion, all of which is payable beyond the next 12 months. Future interest payments associated with these borrowings total $974 million, of which $168 million is payable within 12 months. See Note 15, Borrowings , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. 

Operating Leases. The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2043. At December 31, 2022, the Company had operating lease payment obligations of approximately $2.3 billion, of which $142 million is payable within 12 months. See Note 13, Leases , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. 

Investment Commitments. At December 31, 2022, the Company had $884 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including CIPs. These products include various illiquid alternative products, including private equity funds and real assets funds, and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients. 

Compensation and Benefit Obligations. The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2022 totaled $2.3 billion and included annual incentive compensation of $1.4 billion, deferred compensation of $0.5 billion and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $0.4 billion. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2023, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over various periods, with the majority payable over periods of up to three years. 

Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for market data, technology, office-related services, marketing and promotional services, and obligations for equipment. Purchase obligations are recorded on the consolidated financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services and equipment not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the Company had purchase obligations of $650 million, of which approximately $190 million is payable within 12 months. 

&#160; 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by the Company&#8217;s application of accounting policies. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to understanding the consolidated financial statements. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. 

Consolidation 

The Company consolidates entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. The company has a controlling financial interest when it owns a majority of the VRE or is a primary beneficiary (&#8220;PB&#8221;) of a VIE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity&#8217;s legal organization, the entity&#8217;s capital structure, the rights of equity investment holders, the Company&#8217;s contractual involvement with and economic interest in the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company&#8217;s involvement with the entity. Entities that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Entities that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the PB of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it (1) has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities&#8217; economic performance and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. There is judgment involved in assessing whether the Company is the PB of a VIE. In addition, the Company&#8217;s ownership interest in VIEs is subject to variability and is impacted by actions of other investors such as on-going redemptions and contributions. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once its economic interest falls below 10%. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was deemed to be the PB of 90 VIEs. See Note 6, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information. 

Fair Value Measurements 

The Company&#8217;s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , and Note 8, Fair Value Disclosures , in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements. 

Changes in Valuation. Changes in value on $5.3 billion of investments will impact the Company&#8217;s nonoperating income (expense), $635 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $1.6 billion relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). At December 31, 2022, changes in fair value of $3.2 billion of CIPs will impact BlackRock&#8217;s net income (loss) attributable to NCI on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock&#8217;s net exposure to changes in fair value of CIPs was $2.1 billion. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets 

Goodwill. Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment assessment performed as of July 31, 2022 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2022, the Company&#8217;s common stock closed at $708.63, which exceeded its book value of $252.04 per share. 

Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. Indefinite-lived intangible assets represent the value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open-end investment funds, collective trust funds and certain other commingled products without a specified termination date. The assignment of indefinite lives to such contracts primarily is based upon the following: (1) the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these products; (2) the Company expects to, and has the ability to, continue to operate these products indefinitely; (3) the products have multiple investors and are not reliant on a single investor or small group of investors for their continued operation; (4) current competitive factors and economic conditions do not indicate a finite life; and (5) there is a high likelihood of continued renewal based on historical experience. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles if they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. 

Finite-lived intangible assets represent finite-lived investor/customer relationships, technology related assets, and management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds, that are expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the Company for a specified period of time. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2022 ranged from approximately 1 to 8 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of approximately 6 years. 

The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired at least annually, as of July 31st, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset might be impaired. 

In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than its carrying value, BlackRock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant quantitative factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considered other qualitative factors including: (1) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (2) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the Company operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity&#8217;s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (3) Company-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset, which is generally determined using an income approach, is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. 

&#160; 

For finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform a recoverability test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Factors included in evaluating finite-lived customer relationships, technology related assets and trade names include technology services revenue trends, customer attrition rates, obsolescence rates, and royalty rates. For finite-lived management contracts, evaluation is based on changes in assumptions including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current estimated fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs. 

In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company&#8217;s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company&#8217;s amortization expense, which was $151 million, $147 million and $106 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

In 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments. The Company determined that no impairment charges were required and that the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes were required to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes revenues when its obligations related to the services are satisfied and it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue amount would not occur in future periods. The Company enters into contracts that can include multiple services, which are accounted for separately if they are determined to be distinct. Management judgment is required in assessing the probability of significant revenue reversal and in identification of distinct services. 

The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees which are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the Company. Fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of AUM and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. Such fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. AUM represents the broad range of financial assets the Company manages for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset values). 

The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods. 

Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund&#8217;s investment or when the investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold at the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgment is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the amounts are dependent on the financial markets and, thus, are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company&#8217;s influence; (2) the ultimate payments have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to (a) invest or reinvest their sales proceeds or (b) distribute their sales proceeds, and determine the timing of such distributions. 

The Company is allocated/distributed carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition. 

The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, is unknown. See Note 17, Revenue , in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for 2022 and 2021. 

The Company earns revenue for providing technology services. Determining the amount of revenue to recognize requires judgment and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement, are distinct performance obligations, and should be accounted for separately. Other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time. Fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed over time and are generally determined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform or on a fixed-rate basis. Revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights. 

Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock&#8217;s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on AUM, recognized when known, and given the Company does not record performance fee revenue until: (1) performance thresholds have been exceeded and (2) management determines the fees are no longer

probable of significant reversal. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies , in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on revenue recognition, including other revenue streams. 

Income Taxes 

The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company&#8217;s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit. 

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

Significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company&#8217;s current estimates. At December 31, 2022, BlackRock had $912 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $497 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. 

Management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2022, the Company had deferred income tax assets of $237 million and deferred income tax liabilities of $3.4 billion on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company. 

The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. The assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company&#8217;s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.
