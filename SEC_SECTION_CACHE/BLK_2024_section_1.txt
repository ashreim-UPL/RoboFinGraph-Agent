(together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, &#8220;BlackRock&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $10.0 trillion of assets under management (&#8220;AUM&#8221;) at December 31, 2023. With approximately 19,800 employees in more than 30 countries who serve clients in over 100 countries across the globe, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment management and technology services to institutional and retail clients worldwide. 

BlackRock&#8217;s diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes enables the Company to offer choice and tailor investment and asset allocation solutions for clients. Product offerings include single- and multi-asset portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. Products are offered directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, iShares &#174; and BlackRock exchange-traded funds (&#8220;ETFs&#8221;), separate accounts, collective trust funds and other pooled investment vehicles. BlackRock also offers technology services, including the investment and risk management technology platform, Aladdin &#174; , Aladdin Wealth, eFront, and Cachematrix, as well as advisory services and solutions to a broad base of institutional and wealth management clients. The Company is highly regulated and manages its clients&#8217; assets as a fiduciary. The Company does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients. 

BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail intermediaries. 

BlackRock maintains a significant global sales and marketing presence that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management and technology service relationships by marketing its services to investors directly and through third-party distribution relationships, including financial professionals and pension consultants. 

BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and over 85% of its Board of Directors consisting of independent directors. 

Management seeks to deliver value for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on BlackRock&#8217;s differentiated competitive position, including: 

&#8226; the Company&#8217;s longstanding model of client choice, through which it offers a wide range of index, active, and whole portfolio solutions across broad markets, themes, regions, and investment styles; 

&#8226; the Company's focus on strong investment performance, seeking the best risk-adjusted returns for client portfolios, within the mandates given by clients, to help them meet their investment objectives; 

&#8226; the Company's research, data and analytics, which are at the center of BlackRock's investment approach and processes. They inform BlackRock's pursuit of the best risk-adjusted returns, and underpin product creation and innovation; 

&#8226; the Company&#8217;s global reach and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 55% of employees outside the United States (&#8220;US&#8221;) serving clients locally and supporting local investment capabilities. Approximately 40% of total AUM is managed for clients domiciled outside the US; 

&#8226; the Company&#8217;s differentiated client relationships and fiduciary focus, which enable effective positioning toward changing client needs and industry trends including the secular shift to ETFs; growing allocations to private markets, such as infrastructure and private credit; increasing demand for outsourcing and whole portfolio solutions using index, active and illiquid alternatives products; anticipated re-allocations to fixed income; demand for high-performing active strategies; interest in sustainable investment strategies; and a continued focus on income and retirement; and 

&#8226; the Company&#8217;s longstanding commitment to innovation, technology services and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BlackRock technology products and solutions, including Aladdin, Aladdin Wealth, eFront, and Cachematrix. This commitment is further extended by minority investments in financial technology and digital distribution providers, data and whole portfolio capabilities including Upvest, Avaloq, Human Interest, Circle, SpiderRock Advisors, Clarity AI, Envestnet, Acorns, Scalable Capital and iCapital. 

BlackRock operates in a global marketplace impacted by changing market dynamics and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period. 

The Company&#8217;s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business, including business in Aladdin and other technology products and services. New business efforts depend on BlackRock&#8217;s ability to achieve clients&#8217; investment objectives, in a manner consistent with their risk preferences, to deliver excellent client service and to innovate in technology to serve clients&#8217; evolving needs. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain qualified professionals is critical to the Company&#8217;s long-term success.

##TABLE_END (1) Net of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (redeemable and nonredeemable). 

(2) BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;); however, management believes evaluating the Company&#8217;s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. 

Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, BlackRock updated the definitions of operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, to include new adjustments. Such measures have been recast for all prior periods to reflect the inclusion of such new adjustments. In addition, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, BlackRock updated the definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans which the Company began economically hedging in 2023. For further information on non-GAAP financial measures and for as adjusted items for 2023 and 2022, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Non-GAAP Financial Measures . For further information on non-GAAP financial measures and for as adjusted items for 2021, 2020 and 2019, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Non-GAAP Financial Measures , of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.

##TABLE_END (1) Amounts include the following: (a) net AUM from the acquisition of Aperio Group, LLC (&#8220;Aperio Transaction&#8221;) in February 2021, and (b) net AUM from the acquisition of Kreos Capital in August 2023 (the &#8220;Kreos Transaction&#8221;). 

&#160; 

AUM represents the broad range of financial assets managed for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which BlackRock provides risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice, or assets that the Company is retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis. 

Investment management fees are typically earned as a percentage of AUM. BlackRock also earns performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, the Company also may earn securities lending revenue. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietary Aladdin investment system as well as risk management, outsourcing, advisory and other technology services, to institutional investors and wealth management intermediaries. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users, implementation go-lives and software solution delivery and support. 

At December 31, 2023, total AUM was $10.0 trillion, representing a CAGR of 11% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net inflows and acquisitions, including the net AUM impact from the Aperio Transaction, which added $41.3 billion of AUM in February 2021, and the Kreos Transaction, which added $2.2 billion of AUM in August 2023. Our AUM mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range, as described below. 

The Company considers the categorization of its AUM by client type, product type, investment style, and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Company&#8217;s AUM will be organized as follows:

ETFs are a growing component of both institutional and retail client portfolios. However, as ETFs are traded on exchanges, complete transparency on the ultimate end-client is unavailable. Therefore, ETFs are presented as a separate client type below, with investments in ETFs by institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections. 

AUM by investment style and client type at December 31, 2023 is presented below.

##TABLE_END Retail 

BlackRock serves retail investors globally through a wide array of products across the investment spectrum, including separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and private investment funds. Retail investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Technology solutions, digital distribution tools and a shift toward portfolio construction are increasing the number of financial advisors and end-retail investors using BlackRock products. 

Retail represented 10% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2023 and 31% of long-term investment advisory and administration fees (collectively &#8220;base fees&#8221;) and securities lending revenue for 2023. 

ETFs have a significant retail component but are shown separately below. With the exclusion of ETFs, the majority of retail AUM is comprised of active mutual funds. In the aggregate, active and index mutual funds totaled $705 billion, or approximately 75%, of retail long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts. Approximately 75% of retail long-term AUM is invested in active products.

##TABLE_END The retail client base is diversified geographically, with 69% of long-term AUM managed for investors based in the Americas, 26% in EMEA and 5% in Asia-Pacific at year-end 2023. 

&#8226; US retail long-term net outflows of $5 billion were driven by outflows from alternatives, fixed income and multi-asset of $6 billion, $2 billion and $1 billion, respectively, partially offset by equity net inflows of $5 billion. Alternatives and fixed income net outflows were primarily from rising-rate-sensitive strategies, including event driven, multi-strategy credit and unconstrained bond funds. Multi-asset net outflows were driven by world allocation and multi-asset income strategies. Equity net inflows of $5 billion reflected flows in Aperio, BlackRock&#8217;s customized index equity solution. 

&#8226; International retail long-term net outflows of $4 billion were driven by alternatives and equity net outflows of $2 billion each, primarily due to redemptions from event driven and unconstrained strategies. 

ETFs 

BlackRock is the leading ETF provider in the world with $3.5 trillion of AUM as of December 31, 2023. BlackRock generated ETF net inflows of $186 billion in 2023. The majority of ETF AUM and net inflows represent the Company&#8217;s index-tracking iShares-branded ETFs. The Company also offers active BlackRock-branded ETFs that seek outperformance and/or differentiated outcomes and certain iShares-branded ETFs that seek defined outcomes. 

Fixed income ETF net inflows of $112 billion were diversified across exposures, led by flows into treasury, core and corporate credit ETFs. Equity ETF net inflows of $81 billion were driven by flows into core ETFs, as well as continued client use of BlackRock&#8217;s broad-based precision exposure ETFs to express risk preferences and make tactical allocation changes during the year. Alternative ETFs had net outflows of $6 billion, primarily driven by commodities funds. 

ETFs represented 38% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2023 and 43% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2023.

##TABLE_END (1) Amounts include AUM attributable to the Kreos Transaction. 

&#160; 

Institutional active AUM ended 2023 at $1.9 trillion, reflecting $87 billion of net inflows, driven by the funding of several significant outsourcing mandates and continued growth in our LifePath&#174; target-date and private markets platforms. 

Multi-asset net inflows of $86 billion reflected continued growth from significant pension outsourcing mandates and LifePath target-date offerings. Fixed income net inflows of $5 billion similarly reflected the funding of insurance outsourcing mandates. Equity net outflows of $13 billion were primarily from quantitative equity strategies. 

Alternatives net inflows of $10 billion were led by infrastructure, private credit and private equity. Excluding return of capital and investment of $7 billion, alternatives net inflows were $17 billion. At year-end, BlackRock had approximately $32 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded, uninvested commitments to deploy for institutional clients, which is not included in AUM. 

Institutional active represented 21% of long-term AUM and 19% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2023. 

Institutional index AUM totaled $2.9 trillion at December 31, 2023, reflecting $55 billion of net outflows, driven by equities. 

Institutional index represented 31% of long-term AUM and 7% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2023. 

The Company&#8217;s institutional clients consist of the following: 

&#8226; Pensions, Foundations and Endowments BlackRock is among the world&#8217;s largest managers of pension plan assets with $3.0 trillion, or 63%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2023. The market landscape continues to shift from defined benefit to defined contribution, and our defined contribution channel represented $1.5 trillion of total pension AUM. BlackRock remains well positioned for the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $83 billion, or 2%, of long-term institutional AUM was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments. 

&#8226; Official Institutions BlackRock managed $272 billion, or 6%, of long-term institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2023. These clients often require specialized investment advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support. 

&#8226; Financial and Other Institutions BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $650 billion, or 13%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end 2023. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which the Company provides sub-advisory services, totaled $773 billion, or 16%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.

##TABLE_END (1) Amounts include AUM attributable to the Kreos Transaction. 

Long-term product offerings include active and index strategies. Our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. In contrast, index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Index products include both our non-ETF index products and ETFs. 

Although many clients use both active and index strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. Net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on BlackRock&#8217;s revenues and earnings. 

Equity 

Year-end 2023 equity AUM totaled $5.3 trillion, reflecting net outflows of $11 billion. Net outflows included $27 billion and $66 billion out of active and non-ETF index, respectively, partially offset by ETF net inflows of $81 billion. 

BlackRock&#8217;s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock&#8217;s equity AUM is tied to international market strategies, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than US equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which may not consistently move in tandem with US markets, have a greater impact on BlackRock&#8217;s equity revenues and effective fee rate. 

Equity represented 58% of long-term AUM and 53% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2023. 

Fixed Income 

Fixed income AUM ended 2023 at $2.8 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $143 billion. Net inflows included $112 billion and $32 billion into ETFs and non-ETF index, respectively, partially offset by $1 billion of net outflows from active. Fixed income ETF net inflows of $112 billion reflected the benefit of our diverse product offering and included strong flows into treasury, core and corporate credit ETFs. 

Fixed income represented 30% of long-term AUM and 26% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2023. 

Multi-Asset 

BlackRock manages a variety of multi-asset funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities, bonds, and alternatives, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions may include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays. 

Multi-asset represented 9% of long-term AUM and 9% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2023.

##TABLE_END Multi-asset net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $84 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients, including the funding of several significant outsourcing mandates. Defined contribution plans remained a significant driver of flows and contributed $30 billion to institutional multi-asset net inflows in 2023, primarily into target date and target risk product offerings. 

The Company&#8217;s multi-asset strategies include the following: 

&#8226; Target date and target risk strategies generated net inflows of $49 billion. Institutional investors represented 90% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans representing 81% of AUM. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our LifePath offerings. LifePath products utilize a proprietary active asset allocation model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor&#8217;s expected retirement timing. Underlying investments are primarily index products. 

&#8226; Asset allocation and balanced strategies generated $23 billion of net inflows. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Flows in this category included pension outsourcing mandates that funded during the year. Flagship products also include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income fund families. 

&#8226; Fiduciary management services are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of investment management, often with BlackRock acting as outsourced chief investment officer. These customized services require strong partnership with the clients&#8217; investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives. 

Alternatives 

BlackRock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing high-alpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing. Our alternatives products fall into three main categories &#8212; (1) illiquid alternatives, (2) liquid alternatives, and (3) currency and commodities. Illiquid alternatives include offerings in infrastructure, opportunistic and credit, private equity, real estate and alternative solutions. Liquid alternatives include offerings in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions (funds of funds). 

In 2023, liquid and illiquid alternatives generated a combined $2 billion of net inflows, or $10 billion excluding return of capital / return on investment of $8 billion. The largest contributors to return of capital / return on investment were opportunistic and credit strategies, infrastructure and private equity solutions. Net inflows were driven by infrastructure, opportunistic and credit strategies and private equity. At year-end, BlackRock had approximately $32 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded, uninvested commitments, which are expected to be deployed in future years; these commitments are not included in AUM or flows until they are fee-paying. Currency and commodities saw $7 billion of net outflows, primarily from commodities ETFs. 

BlackRock believes that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies, investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings. BlackRock&#8217;s highly diversified alternatives franchise is well positioned to continue to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors. 

Alternatives represented 3% of long-term AUM and 12% of long-term base fees and securities lending revenue for 2023. 

In the first quarter of 2024, BlackRock announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Global Infrastructure Management LLC (referred to herein as Global Infrastructure Partners (&#8220;GIP&#8221;)), a leading independent infrastructure manager with over $100 billion in client AUM as of September 30, 2023. GIP specializes in investing in, owning and operating assets across the energy, transport, digital infrastructure and water and waste management sectors. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to customary regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.

Americas net inflows of $177 billion were driven by net inflows into fixed income, multi-asset, cash, and equity of $83 billion, $60 billion, $39 billion, and $4 billion, respectively.

##TABLE_END Performance Notes 

Past performance is not indicative of future results. Except as specified, the performance information shown is as of December 31, 2023 and is based on preliminary data available at that time. The performance data shown reflects information for all actively and passively managed equity and fixed income accounts, including US registered investment companies, European-domiciled retail funds and separate accounts for which performance data is available, including performance data for high net worth accounts available as of November 30, 2023. The performance data does not include accounts terminated prior to December 31, 2023 and accounts for which data has not yet been verified. If such accounts had been included, the performance data provided may have substantially differed from that shown. 

Performance comparisons shown are gross-of-fees for institutional and high net worth separate accounts, and net-of-fees for retail funds. The performance tracking shown for index accounts is based on gross-of-fees performance and includes all institutional accounts and all iShares funds globally using an index strategy. AUM information is based on AUM available as of December 31, 2023 for each account or fund in the asset class shown without adjustment for overlapping management of the same account or fund. Fund performance reflects the reinvestment of dividends and distributions. 

Performance shown is derived from applicable benchmarks or peer median information, as selected by BlackRock. Peer medians are based in part on data either from Lipper, Inc. or Morningstar, Inc. for each included product.

TECHNOLOGY SERVICES 

BlackRock offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, and wealth management and digital distribution tools on a fee basis. Aladdin is our proprietary technology platform, providing an end-to-end, SaaS solution for investment and risk management for both BlackRock and a growing number of institutional and retail investors around the world. BlackRock offers risk reporting capabilities via Aladdin Risk, as well as investment accounting capabilities. Aladdin Provider is a tool used by asset servicers, connecting them to the platform used by asset managers and owners to add operational efficiency. In 2019, BlackRock acquired eFront, a leading end-to-end alternative investment management software and solutions provider to enable clients to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform. eFront is offered to clients both as a standalone offering and as part of an integrated &#8220;Whole Portfolio View&#8221; solution that provides transparency across clients&#8217; public and private assets. Through our Cachematrix platform, BlackRock is also a leading provider of financial technology which simplifies the cash management process for banks and their corporate clients in a streamlined, open-architecture platform. 

BlackRock offers a number of wealth management technology tools offering personalized digital advice, portfolio construction capabilities and risk analytics for retail distributors. These tools include Aladdin Wealth, which provides wealth management firms and their financial professionals with institutional-quality business management, portfolio construction, modeling and risk analytics capabilities. 

At year-end, BlackRock technology services clients included banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, asset servicers, retail distributors and other investors across North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Australia. 

Technology services revenue of $1.5 billion was up 9% year-over-year, and annual contract value (&#8220;ACV&#8221;) increased 10% year-over-year. ACV growth was driven by strong net sales of Aladdin in 2023, with over half of new client mandates spanning multiple Aladdin products. Aladdin assignments are typically long-term contracts that provide recurring revenue. At the end of any period, BlackRock generally has recurring revenue contracts in place for a large portion of total annual revenue. BlackRock measures the fees related to these agreements and refers to this as ACV. For further information on ACV, see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Non-GAAP Financial Measures . 

Aladdin, which represented the majority of technology services revenue for the year, continues to benefit from trends favoring global platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions across public and private markets. Approximately 25% of Aladdin&#8217;s revenue was denominated in non-US currencies. In addition, while Aladdin is a multi-asset system, the majority of positions managed on the platform are fixed income. 2023 technology services revenue growth reflected headwinds associated with 2022 bond market declines on Aladdin&#8217;s fixed income platform assets. 

BlackRock is focused on enhancing Aladdin, with continued investment into areas such as whole portfolio, private markets, wealth and sustainable investing solutions. BlackRock continues to evolve and enable clients to further simplify their operating infrastructure with Aladdin. Clients increasingly want to tailor how they use Aladdin to meet their specific needs, and BlackRock is providing them with choice and flexibility. BlackRock is empowering clients with data and opening Aladdin by creating connectivity with ecosystem providers and third-party technology solutions, which include asset servicers, cloud providers, digital asset platforms, trading systems and others. This connectivity helps clients work in their Aladdin environments with a more customized and seamless end-to-end experience. 

In addition, BlackRock has made minority investments in financial technology and digital distribution providers, data and whole portfolio capabilities including Upvest, Avaloq, Human Interest, Circle, SpiderRock Advisors, Clarity AI, Envestnet, Acorns, Scalable Capital and iCapital. BlackRock records its share of income related to minority investments accounted for under the equity method in other revenue and records gains and losses related to changes in value of other minority investments in nonoperating income (expense). 

Securities Lending 

Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. BlackRock receives both cash (primarily for US domiciled portfolios) and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements. The cash management team invests the cash received as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending for US domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings, or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM. 

Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $359 billion, up from $355 billion at year-end 2022. More demand for general collateral securities resulted in slightly higher balances year over year. Intrinsic lending spreads increased and cash reinvestment spreads remained flat as cash yields were stable year over year. 

BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity, and interest rate risk management. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock&#8217;s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived temporarily, such waivers are infrequent. 

Risk and Quantitative Analysis 

Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk and Quantitative Analysis (&#8220;RQA&#8221;) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and enterprise risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms, financial technology providers and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, investment style and discipline, price, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service. 

HUMAN CAPITAL 

With approximately 19,800 employees in more than 30 countries, as of December 31, 2023, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment management and technology services to institutional and retail clients in more than 100 countries across the globe. As an asset manager, BlackRock&#8217;s long-term success depends on its people and how it manages its workforce. 

Culture and Principles 

BlackRock believes that maintaining a strong corporate culture is an important component of its human capital management practices and critical to the firm&#8217;s long-term success. BlackRock&#8217;s culture is underpinned by five core principles that unify its workforce and guide how it interacts with its employees, its clients, the communities in which it operates and its other stakeholders: (1) We are a fiduciary to our clients; (2) We are One BlackRock; (3) We are passionate about performance; (4) We take emotional ownership; and (5) We are committed to a better future. 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (&#8220;DEI&#8221;) 

BlackRock believes a diverse workforce with an inclusive and connected culture is a commercial imperative and indispensable to its success. Ultimately, a dynamic, inclusive organization allows BlackRock to attract and retain top talent around the world and to stay ahead of its clients&#8217; needs. 

BlackRock&#8217;s three pillar DEI strategy is aligned with the firm&#8217;s business priorities and long-term objectives. The three pillars are (1) talent and culture across the globe, which focuses on attracting, developing and retaining top talent by cultivating an inclusive work environment where employees have fair access to opportunities and feel seen, heard, valued and respected, (2) activities to support interested clients, which focus on expanding investment choices and business partnership opportunities with brokers, managers, and suppliers, and (3) impact in underserved communities, which focuses on helping more and more people experience financial well-being through BlackRock philanthropy and employee-led volunteer efforts. 

BlackRock views transparency and measurement as critical to its strategy. Since 2020, the firm has published annual SASB-aligned disclosure and EEO-1 reports, and since 2022, a Global DEI Annual Report. As of January 1, 2024, of the Company&#8217;s employees who self-identified their gender status, approximately 44% of the Company's global workforce, 33% of global senior leaders (Directors or above) and 47% of global new hires, were women. Additionally, as of January 1, 2024, of the Company&#8217;s US employees who self-identified their race/ethnicity status, approximately 8% of employees, 4% of senior leaders and 10% of new hires identified as Black or African American, 8% of employees, 5% of senior leaders and 16% of new hires identified as Latinx, and 28% of employees, 21% of senior leaders and 30% of new hires identified as Asian. Further, of the Company's approximately 19,800 employees as of December 31, 2023, 46% were based in the Americas, 31% were based in EMEA and 23% were based in Asia-Pacific regions. 

Board Oversight of Human Capital Management 

BlackRock&#8217;s Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) plays an important role in the oversight of human capital management and devotes one Board meeting annually to an in-depth review of BlackRock&#8217;s culture, talent development, retention and recruiting initiatives, DEI strategy, leadership and succession planning and employee feedback. Moreover, the Board&#8217;s Management Development and Compensation Committee periodically reviews efforts and developments related to the firm&#8217;s human capital management strategy. 

Succession planning for BlackRock&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives is a key part of the Board&#8217;s annual review of human capital management issues. As part of this review, the Board focuses on whether BlackRock has the right people in place to execute the Company&#8217;s long-term strategic plans, and on BlackRock&#8217;s ability to identify, attract, develop, promote and retain future senior executives. An important element of the succession planning across the organization is a commitment to building leadership from within. 

Employee Engagement 

BlackRock values continuous dialogue with its employees to better understand their experiences at the firm and assess the efficacy of its human capital management practices. The Company uses several employee engagement mechanisms, including: (1) employee opinion pulse surveys; (2) interactive events and communications; (3) the sponsorship of employee networks; and (4) local community involvement. The employee opinion pulse surveys, which BlackRock conducts throughout the year, provide the Company with actionable feedback for its teams and for the Company as a whole. Additionally, BlackRock uses ongoing lifecycle surveys to collect feedback at various points along the employee journey. BlackRock works to keep employees informed and engaged through a regular cadence of communications and events, including newsletters, global and local townhalls and messages from leaders with timely business and organizational updates and culture-building opportunities. BlackRock&#8217;s employee networks also provide additional forums and opportunities for employees with a diverse range of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to connect with one another and enhance the firm&#8217;s culture. Open to all, the networks are designed by employees, for employees, are sponsored by senior leaders and strengthen the One BlackRock community. 

BlackRock believes that employees value opportunities to give back to their communities. Through local, employee-led BlackRock Gives committees, the Company supports nonprofit organizations nominated by employees in the communities where it operates. In addition, the Company has a matching gifts program that provides full-time employees with up to $10,000 per year in matched donations to any IRS qualified charitable organization, Full-time employees are also given two paid volunteer days per year and BlackRock matches volunteer time with eligible charities. 

&#160; 

Compensation, Wellness and Benefits 

BlackRock is committed to responsible business practices and believes that investing in the physical, emotional, mental and financial well-being of its employees is a critical component of the firm&#8217;s human capital management strategy. To that end, the Company designs its compensation and benefits practices to: (1) attract, motivate, and retain talented employees; (2) align employee incentives and risk-taking with that of the firm and the interests of its clients; and (3) support employees and their families across many aspects of their lives. The Company has a strong pay-for-performance culture and an annual compensation process that takes into consideration firmwide results, individual business results and employee performance, as well as market benchmarks. BlackRock also offers a wide range of benefits that it regularly reviews in accordance with market practices and the local requirements of its offices, including, where applicable, retirement savings plans, a Flexible Time Off (&#8220;FTO&#8221;) policy and flexible working arrangements, parental leave and family forming benefits, such as fertility benefits, adoption and surrogacy assistance, and backup elder and childcare benefits. The Company provides comprehensive healthcare and mental-health benefits to eligible employees, including medical, dental and vision coverage, health savings and spending accounts, counseling services, an employee assistance program and access to telemedicine services, where available. The Company also offers a Mental Health Ambassador program that is comprised of global volunteers across office locations who are trained in empathetic listening skills and direct interested colleagues to benefits, tools and resources to support mental health. 

BlackRock prioritizes protecting the rights of its workforce. The Company has implemented policies related to harassment prevention and compliance with equal employment opportunity and overtime regulations. BlackRock is also committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment for its workforce. To do this, it designs global programs, including environmental and occupational health and safety programs, to meet or exceed local requirements. Moreover, BlackRock encourages all of its employees to raise issues of concern and assures employees that they may do so without fear of retaliation. 

Recruiting, Training and Development 

BlackRock recognizes that, like all companies, it is operating in an increasingly competitive environment. As such, the Company engages in efforts to reach top talent, including continued partnerships with organizations that promote talent from many different backgrounds; regularly reviewing job postings for potentially biased language; and actively engaging in outreach and recruitment efforts for its open positions. In the spirit of attracting talent from broad backgrounds, BlackRock also provides formal recruiting programs for Veterans (former service members transitioning to civilian careers) and Returners (individuals who have taken a career break of 18 months or more). 

BlackRock is also committed to innovation, learning and reinvention in all areas of its business and believes that developing the capabilities of its employees is integral to delivering long-term value. To that end, the Company&#8217;s human capital management practices are designed to provide opportunities for employees to learn, innovate and enhance their skillsets at every stage of their career. One example is the BlackRock Academies, the firm&#8217;s online suite of interactive resources and courses, which enable employees to build skills in specific facets of BlackRock&#8217;s business and purpose. The Company believes these opportunities play an important role in engaging BlackRock&#8217;s employees. 

In addition, BlackRock believes that a critical driver of its future success is its ability to grow strong leaders and people managers. The Company invests in leadership development programs designed to foster career growth. For leadership development, BlackRock provides training and makes coaching available to people managers to assist in building foundational skills. 

REGULATION 

Virtually all aspects of BlackRock&#8217;s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, and trust and other fiduciary clients of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (&#8220;BTC&#8221;). Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and trust banks and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations or bank charters, censures and fines both for individuals and BlackRock. The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report. 

BlackRock&#8217;s business may be impacted by numerous regulatory reform initiatives occurring around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes to, or in the enforcement of, existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock&#8217;s business activities, lead to business disruptions, require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs) as well as reputational harm. BlackRock&#8217;s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing banking, securities, taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce. 

GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM 

Policymaking workstreams focused on the financial services sector led by global standard setters, such as the Financial Stability Board (&#8220;FSB&#8221;) and International Organization of Securities Commissions (&#8220;IOSCO&#8221;), may lead to or inform new regulations in multiple jurisdictions in which BlackRock operates. Most recently, such workstreams have focused on areas such as products and activities of money market funds (&#8220;MMFs&#8221;), open-ended funds (&#8220;OEFs&#8221;) and sustainability regulations. 

&#160; 

Macroprudential Policies for Asset Managers 

Concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector have been heightened since the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforced by the Liquidity Driven Investment events in the UK. This has prompted a broad review of existing regulations globally, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural market components in mitigating risks by the FSB, IOSCO, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (&#8220;FSOC&#8221;). In November 2022, the SEC proposed amendments to rules governing OEF liquidity risk management and swing pricing. The European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) also proposed reforms to increase the availability of liquidity management tools to OEFs (including MMFs), enhance reporting on the use of liquidity management tools by OEFs to national regulators and allow such regulators to require OEF managers to activate liquidity management tools in extreme market conditions. Meanwhile, the UK proposed introducing liquidity facilities to certain asset owners, which could result in regulatory burdens on asset managers. If any of these regulatory or policy actions result in broad application of macroprudential tools to OEFs or require changes to structural features of certain OEFs, it could limit BlackRock&#8217;s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock. 

Global MMF Reforms 

Following the market events of March 2020, US, UK and EU authorities initiated a review of existing regulatory frameworks with the aim of improving the resilience of MMFs in market downturns. In the US, the SEC adopted changes to Rule 2a-7, the primary rule under the Investment Company Act of 1940 governing MMFs, including changes to required liquidity levels and certain operational aspects of such funds, and requiring mandatory liquidity fees under certain circumstances. The UK released a consultation in December 2023 indicating their intent to change regulatory requirements for MMFs domiciled or marketed in the UK, including material increases in required liquidity levels. Although EU authorities stated in July 2023 that they would not re-open the EU regulatory framework for MMFs in the near term, the UK&#8217;s proposed changes may increase pressure to implement similar reforms as the vast majority of MMFs sold in the UK are EU-domiciled and regulated. Such regulatory reforms could significantly and adversely impact certain of BlackRock&#8217;s MMF products. 

Environmental, Social and Governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) and Sustainability 

ESG and sustainability have been the subject of increased regulatory focus across jurisdictions. The International Sustainability Standards Board (&#8220;ISSB&#8221;) released its first two disclosure standards in 2023, which may inform national regulators&#8217; approaches. For example, the UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia have already indicated their intention to endorse these standards. In the US, the SEC has proposed a series of rules that would require, among other things: (1) corporate issuers to make substantial climate-related disclosures in periodic reports, including with respect to governance, risk management, business strategy, financial statement metrics and greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) emissions and (2) enhanced ESG disclosures by investment companies and investment advisers in fund and adviser filings, including disclosures on ESG strategies and how ESG factors are considered, and GHG emissions disclosure by certain environmentally focused funds. Furthermore, the SEC has announced plans to propose rules to require enhanced disclosure regarding human capital management and board diversity for public issuers. It has also increased scrutiny of disclosure and compliance issues relating to investment advisers&#8217; and funds&#8217; ESG strategies, policies and procedures. In addition, the US Department of Labor (&#8220;DOL&#8221;) issued final rules clarifying that Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;) plan fiduciaries can, but are not required to, consider the economic effects of ESG factors for purposes of investing ERISA plan assets and exercising voting rights with respect to plan investments. Moreover, California passed several laws in 2023 that will require companies doing business in California to make certain types of climate-related disclosures, and other states may adopt similar laws. 

The EU has enacted numerous regulations on ESG and sustainability, including on sustainability-related disclosures by financial market participants; integration of sustainability considerations into investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors; making the advice and financial product distribution process more receptive to end-investor sustainability preferences; and requiring asset managers to report against an EU-wide taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities and make detailed disclosures relating to ESG characteristics of funds and portfolios. Further regulations include the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which will require enhanced sustainability reporting for EU-based corporate issuers, with phased implementation beginning in 2024 and for a wider group of global companies from 2028. In December 2023, the EU reached provisional agreement on a directive, which if adopted in its current form, would require a wide group of European and global companies to provide transition plans and conduct due diligence on the sustainability of their suppliers. The EU and the UK Financial Conduct Authority (&#8220;FCA&#8221;) are also developing rules and guidelines for the use of ESG or sustainability related terms in fund names, focused on specifying a minimum threshold of assets meeting ESG or sustainable criteria for such funds. 

Within the UK, the FCA has proposed UK-specific sustainability regulations, including a sustainable product classification system for funds and enhanced disclosure requirements, which are expected to apply on a staggered basis from July 2024. In addition, His Majesty's Treasury (&#8220;HMT&#8221;) released a consultation to bring ESG rating providers under regulation by the FCA and will consult on a UK-specific taxonomy of environmentally sustainable activities. 

A number of Asia-Pacific jurisdictions are consulting on sustainability reporting obligations aligned with the ISSB standards. Similarly, policymakers in Japan have announced that they are preparing a local version of the ISSB standards. Japan and Singapore have published codes of conduct for ESG data and ratings providers, with Hong Kong considering a similar approach, while India introduced a regulatory framework for ESG ratings providers in July 2023. 

Taxation 

BlackRock&#8217;s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. Legislation at both the US federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax (&#8220;FTT&#8221;) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the EU, certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the European Commission (&#8220;EC&#8221;) has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock&#8217;s financial results and clients&#8217; performance results. 

&#160; 

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (&#8220;OECD&#8221;) has proposed certain international tax reforms, which, among other things, would (1) shift taxing rights to the jurisdiction of the consumer and (2) establish a global minimum tax for multinational companies of 15% (namely the &#8220;Pillar One&#8221; and &#8220;Pillar Two&#8221; Framework). EU member states adopted, or plan to adopt, laws implementing the OECD&#8217;s minimum tax rules under the Pillar Two Framework, which are expected to go into effect in 2024. Several other countries, including the UK, have changed or are considering changes to their tax law to implement the OECD&#8217;s minimum tax proposal. As a result of these developments, the tax laws of certain countries in which BlackRock does business have and may continue to change, and any such changes could increase its tax liabilities. The Company is continuing to monitor legislative developments and evaluate the potential impact of the Pillar Two Framework on future periods. 

The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock&#8217;s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm. 

Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives 

Jurisdictions outside the US in which BlackRock operates have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing, more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact BlackRock and the broader markets. For example, various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed have required or will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules impose requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions, requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), reporting transactions to central data repositories, mandating certain documentation standards, requiring the posting and collection of initial and/or variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed and/or over-the-counter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements. 

In the US, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to central clearing and trading venue execution requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future. In the EU and UK, central clearing and trading venue requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of BlackRock funds and accounts. Further, most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared, including non-deliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions, are subject to requirements in the US, EU, UK and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect mark-to-market margin payments. For certain BlackRock funds and accounts, initial margin requirements also apply in addition to such mark-to-market margin payments. These rules and regulations increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for BlackRock's clients, in certain cases produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules, and increase BlackRock&#8217;s operational and legal risks. 

US REGULATORY REFORM 

Antitrust Rules and Guidance 

In 2023, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the &#8220;DOJ&#8221;) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking with amendments to rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (&#8220;HSR&#8221;) that require parties in certain transactions to provide the FTC and DOJ prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would significantly expand the information required to be reported and documentation to be submitted in connection with an HSR filing. If enacted as drafted, the proposed rules could substantially increase BlackRock&#8217;s pre-merger notification expenses and delay transactions. In December 2023 the FTC and DOJ also jointly issued new merger guidelines, which could impact the ability of the Company to expand its services through strategic investments or acquisitions. 

Designation as a Systemically Important Financial Institution (&#8220;SIFI&#8221;) 

The FSOC has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the US under the Dodd-Frank Act. In November 2023, the FSOC finalized amendments to its existing interpretive guidance to remove the prioritization of an activities-based approach over an entity-specific approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks to financial stability, although the amendment clarified that the FSOC retained the ability to use an activities-based approach when appropriate. If BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory and capital requirements and direct supervision by the Federal Reserve. 

US DOL Fiduciary Rule 

In October 2023, the US DOL proposed a new regulation redefining the meaning of &#8220;investment advice fiduciary&#8221; under ERISA as well as amendments to several prohibited transaction exemptions applicable to investment advice fiduciaries. If adopted as proposed, the rule would substantially expand when a person would be considered a fiduciary subject to ERISA and could require BlackRock to revise a number of its distribution relationships, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock and its distribution partners, and limit BlackRock&#8217;s ability to provide certain services to applicable clients. 

Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives 

The SEC, Federal Reserve, the Internal Revenue Service and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;) each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts. If adopted, any such limitations or restrictions could require BlackRock to change certain business practices or implement new compliance processes, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions. 

&#160; 

In October 2020, the SEC adopted regulations governing the use of derivatives by registered investment companies (&#8220;RICs&#8221;), including mutual funds (other than MMFs), ETFs and closed-end funds, as well as business development companies. RICs were required to implement and comply with this rule beginning in 2022. The rule, among other things, imposes limits on the amount of derivatives transactions a RIC can enter into, eliminates the asset segregation compliance framework and introduces new compliance requirements for funds, including the establishment of comprehensive risk management programs. The rule may impact certain RICs&#8217; usage of derivatives and investment strategy. 

In 2021, the SEC proposed rules in connection with security-based swaps (&#8220;SBS&#8221;) transactions to require public reporting of large SBS positions. These rules, if adopted as proposed, may affect the types of transactions BlackRock may choose to execute in SBS or other SBS-related assets, introduce or increase costs relating to such transactions, and impact the liquidity in the SBS markets in which BlackRock transacts. 

SEC Proposed Rules on Private Fund Advisers 

In 2023, the SEC adopted new rules and amendments to enhance regulation of private fund advisors. These included amendments to Form PF for registered investment advisers requiring new disclosures, filing obligations and enhanced reporting. The SEC adopted additional rules requiring registered private fund advisers to, among other things, provide quarterly reports to fund investors, obtain annual audits for funds, distribute fairness opinions in connection with certain transactions, prohibit certain types of preferential terms and treatment, and provide transparency to investors of all types of preferential treatment granted to other investors in the same fund. Implementing these rules and amendments may significantly increase BlackRock&#8217;s reporting, disclosure and compliance obligations and create operational complexity for BlackRock&#8217;s alternatives products. 

Proposed Rules on Regulation ATS 

In 2023, the SEC re-proposed amendments to Regulation ATS. The proposed rules would expand the types of systems that could fall within the definition of &#8220;exchange&#8221; and extend Regulation ATS and Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity to systems involving US government securities trading. If enacted as proposed, these rules may increase compliance costs for BlackRock. 

SEC US Treasury Clearing Mandate 

In December 2023, the SEC adopted rules mandating central clearing of US Treasury repurchases and certain other Treasury transactions. The rules require many market participants, including a large number of BlackRock funds and accounts, to clear Treasury repurchase transactions and potentially certain cash Treasury securities transactions through a clearing agency registered with the SEC, which could increase transaction costs for BlackRock&#8217;s clients. 

Proposed Rules on Equity Market Structure 

In 2023, the SEC proposed equity market structure reforms that would significantly change how national market system (&#8220;NMS&#8221;) stock orders are priced, executed and reported. The reforms include: (1) a requirement for certain retail orders to be subject to order-by-order competition, (2) an SEC-level best execution rule and (3) an adjustment to the tick sizes at which NMS stocks can be quoted or traded. If enacted as proposed, the collective impact of the rules may adversely affect market efficiency and execution costs, which would result in negative effects for BlackRock&#8217;s business and clients. 

SEC Rules on Short Sales and Reporting of Securities Loans 

In 2023, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring certain institutional managers to report short positions and activity to the SEC for publication on an aggregate basis, which could potentially impact investment strategies and result in greater operational burdens and cost for BlackRock. The SEC also adopted a new rule requiring certain persons to report information on securities loan transactions to a registered national securities association which will then publish certain information. The rule may increase BlackRock&#8217;s operational burdens and costs. 

SEC Standard Settlement Rules 

In 2023, the SEC adopted amendments and new rules which, among other things, shortened the standard settlement for most securities transactions to one business day after the trade date (T+1), which will likely increase BlackRock&#8217;s operational burdens and costs. 

SEC Predictive Data Analytics Rules 

The SEC proposed new rules in 2023 that would require broker-dealers and investment advisers, when engaging or communicating with investors using predictive data analytics (&#8220;PDA&#8221;) and PDA-like technologies, to evaluate such technologies for conflicts of interest and, where identified, eliminate or neutralize the conflict of interest. If adopted as proposed, the rules could encompass a wide range of forward-looking uses of technology applications and impose significant operational burdens and costs. 

SEC Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers 

The SEC has recently engaged in various initiatives and reviews impacting regulatory structure governing the asset management industry and registered investment companies. For example, the SEC adopted rules requiring certain funds to provide tailored fund shareholder reports, adopted final amendments to the rule governing fund names, expanding the scope of the rule to fund names including growth, value, ESG or similar terms, and proposed rules governing outsourcing of certain functions by investment advisers to service providers. 

&#160; 

INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY REFORM 

Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms 

The EU&#8217;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (&#8220;DORA&#8221;), which focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology and data services, will become applicable beginning in January 2025. DORA will, among other things: (1) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing and information sharing requirements to several of BlackRock&#8217;s European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (2) potentially subject Aladdin to additional oversight. In parallel with DORA, the UK proposed a new Critical Third Party regime to regulate certain third parties designated by HMT as &#8220;critical&#8221; to the financial sector, and UK regulators have issued a consultation on proposed requirements for &#8220;critical&#8221; third parties, with further consultations expected in 2024. 

Retail Investment Strategy 

In 2023, the European Commission (&#8220;EC&#8221;) adopted a Retail Investment Strategy package with wide-reaching amendments intended to enhance protections for retail investors. If enacted as proposed, these changes may impact BlackRock&#8217;s operations in European markets, including product development, client servicing and distribution models. 

FSMA 2023 

The Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (&#8220;FSMA 2023&#8221;) reflects significant changes to the UK framework for financial services regulation, including changes that: (1) revoke retained EU law related to financial services regulation, (2) amend the UK Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation frameworks, (3) establish a new designated activities regime and (4) reform the financial promotion regime for unauthorized firms. The UK government and FCA are expected to publish further legislation setting out specific changes impacting the UK market in 2024. 

Mansion House Reforms 

The Mansion House reforms announced in July 2023 also build on the new UK regulatory framework enabled by the FSMA 2023. Potential impacts to the asset management sector include: (1) repeal and replacement of the packaged retail and insurance based investment products ("PRIIPs") Regulation; (2) review of the UK&#8217;s green finance strategy, including potential regulation of ESG data providers; (3) review of governance through the Senior Managers and Certification Regime; (4) repeal of EU legislation on the European Long-Term Investment Fund; (5) market infrastructure reforms; (6) reassessment of the boundary between investment advice and financial guidance; and (7) independent review of the UK investment research landscape. 

Overseas Fund Regime (&#8220;OFR&#8221;) 

OFR, the simplified regime through which non-UK funds can register with the FCA to be marketed to UK retail investors, was enacted in February 2022 and is expected to be implemented through 2024. OFR requires consumer protection regimes in EU countries where BlackRock funds are domiciled to be found equivalent to the UK&#8217;s regime in order to market such funds in the UK. 

Conduct Regulation 

The FCA continues to focus on conduct regulation, including the implementation of the Consumer Duty by all asset management firms, including BlackRock&#8217;s UK subsidiaries. The Consumer Duty rules require firms to act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers in their manufacture and distribution of products and services, in respect of price and value, consumer understanding and consumer support. Any failure to meet the FCA&#8217;s regulatory expectations could expose BlackRock to regulatory sanctions and increased reputational risk. 

UK Stewardship Code Review 

The UK Financial Reporting Council has announced a planned review of the UK Stewardship Code in 2024 to consider potential revisions to address stakeholder concerns. 

Reform of Investment Markets 

BlackRock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives that may affect the Company&#8217;s provision of investment services globally. In Europe, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&#8220;MiFID&#8221;) governing the provision of investment services has been revised and is accompanied by an associated Regulation (together with certain secondary regulation, &#8220;MiFID II&#8221;). The Regulation&#8217;s requirements generally apply consistently across the EU. The MiFID II reforms were substantive, materially changing market transparency requirements, enhancing protections afforded to investors, and increasing operational complexity for the Company. Forthcoming proposals to review the operation of MiFID II and to develop a new EU Retail Investment Strategy may affect the European market structure and impact BlackRock&#8217;s ability to operate in European markets. The broad nature of MiFID II means future reforms could also affect product development, client servicing and distribution models. Similar reforms have been implemented in Switzerland and Australia. 

Regulatory Environment in China 

The Company&#8217;s operations in China are subject to a number of regulatory risks, including an evolving regulatory environment and complex data security and data transfer regulations. These factors may increase compliance risk and costs, limit the Company&#8217;s ability to source and execute new investment opportunities and lead to impairment losses on its investments. Restrictions on transfers of certain types of onshore data of the Company&#8217;s Chinese entities to offshore entities also may limit BlackRock&#8217;s ability to aggregate, report and monitor such data on its global platform. In addition, a number of regulators in China have jurisdiction over BlackRock&#8217;s business operations, increasing operational and regulatory engagement complexity. These risks may be further heightened by additional scrutiny by Chinese regulators of certain sectors, such as technology and other industries that might be deemed to be of national importance. 

E XISTING US REGULATION - OVERVIEW 

BlackRock and certain of its US subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the DOL, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), the National Futures Association (&#8220;NFA&#8221;), the FTC, the Department of Justice, the CFTC and other federal government agencies and regulatory bodies. 

&#160; 

Certain of BlackRock&#8217;s US subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies. In addition, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the &#8220;Advisers Act&#8221;) imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as certain BlackRock subsidiaries, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. State level regulation through attorneys general, insurance commissioners and other state level agencies also applies to certain BlackRock activities. 

The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;) imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as certain BlackRock subsidiaries and affiliates. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser&#8217;s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage. 

BlackRock&#8217;s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), as well as the rules of various securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, as well as restrictions on BlackRock&#8217;s activities and damage to its reputation. Furthermore, the Dodd-Frank Act requires one of BlackRock&#8217;s subsidiaries, BTC, to register as a municipal advisor (as that term is defined in the Exchange Act) with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (&#8220;MSRB&#8221;). BTC's registration as a municipal advisor subjects BTC to additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB. 

BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, real estate funds, collective trust funds, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rulemaking or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators in this area. 

Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to ERISA, and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOL, insofar as they act as a &#8220;fiduciary&#8221; under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients that are subject to ERISA. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require certain BlackRock entities to carry bonds insuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to clients that are not subject to ERISA. 

BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators and/or commodity trading advisors with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. In addition, two of BlackRock&#8217;s subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer&#8217;s permitted activities. One of the broker-dealers is also a member of the MSRB and is subject to MSRB rules. 

BlackRock&#8217;s business activity in California that involves the processing of personal information is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;) and the California Privacy Rights Act (&#8220;CPRA&#8221;), which provide for enhanced consumer protections for California residents. The CCPA and CPRA impose obligations on BlackRock for the handling, disclosure and deletion of personal information for California residents. In addition, several other US states have proposed or adopted similar privacy laws. Any failure by BlackRock to comply with the CCPA, CPRA or similar state privacy laws may result in fines, heightened regulatory scrutiny, litigation and/or reputational harm. 

US Banking Regulation 

One of BlackRock&#8217;s subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a nationally-chartered limited purpose trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as laws and regulations governing capital adequacy, fiduciary activities, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and the prevention of financial crime, including money laundering. BTC is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC and/or BTC&#8217;s customers rather than BlackRock, its affiliates or stockholders. 

EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION &#8212; OVERVIEW 

BlackRock&#8217;s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, these operations are also affected by US laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application. 

Below is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock&#8217;s subsidiaries conduct business. 

Of note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and complex regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company. 

&#160; 

European Regulation 

The FCA currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the UK. It is also responsible for the conduct of business regulation of the UK branch of one of BlackRock&#8217;s US subsidiaries. In addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority (&#8220;PRA&#8221;) regulates one BlackRock UK insurance subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and (where relevant) the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services-related business in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the &#8220;FSMA&#8221;). The FCA&#8217;s rules adopted under the FSMA govern the majority of a firm&#8217;s capital and liquidity resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business requirements, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to BlackRock&#8217;s UK-based insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises BlackRock&#8217;s UK-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and thematic reviews in order to monitor BlackRock&#8217;s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA&#8217;s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against BlackRock&#8217;s UK-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees. 

In addition, BlackRock has regulated entities in France, Germany, Ireland, Jersey, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Each of these entities is required to comply with regulatory rules in the country in which it has been established, including the branches of the Netherlands entity which operate across the EU. 

BlackRock&#8217;s EU subsidiaries and branches must comply with the EU regulatory regime set out in MiFID II. BlackRock&#8217;s UK-regulated subsidiaries must comply with the UK version of MiFID II, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities in the UK. MiFID II, and the UK equivalent of MiFID II, set out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. The legislation also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock UK subsidiaries must also comply with the UK regulation which implements the Consolidated Life Directive and Insurance Distribution Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for certain investment firms arising out of the IFPR. These include requirements to ensure capital adequacy, as well as matters of governance and remuneration. Relevant BlackRock entities must also comply with the requirements of the UCITS Directive and the AIFMD, as implemented in the relevant EU Member States and in the UK, which impose obligations on the authorization and capital, conduct of business, organization, transparency and marketing of retail and alternative investment funds respectively that are sold in, or marketed to, the EU. The obligations introduced through these regulations and directives will affect certain of BlackRock&#8217;s European operations. Compliance with the UCITS Directives and the AIFMD may subject BlackRock to additional expenses associated with depositary oversight and other organizational requirements. BlackRock&#8217;s EU-regulated subsidiaries are also subject to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation ("EMIR") (or the UK version of EMIR transposed into UK law in accordance with The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in the case of BlackRock&#8217;s UK-regulated subsidiaries), an EU regulation governing derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which requires (1) the central clearing of certain OTC derivatives; (2) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives (including the exchange of collateral with certain counterparties); and (3) the reporting of all derivative contracts to an ESMA registered or recognized derivatives trade repository (or a UK authorized trade repository in the case of the UK version of EMIR). 

The EU has seen an increase in Common Supervisory Actions by ESMA to coordinate supervisory action by national EU regulators, most notably in areas such as product governance, liquidity management and fund costs and charges. BlackRock&#8217;s EU operations may be affected to the extent this initiative results in formal legislation or action. 

EU Member States, the UK and many other non-US jurisdictions have adopted statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection and requiring notification of personal data security breaches if certain thresholds are met. For example, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;), which became effective in 2018, and the UK transposed the GDPR into national law (&#8220;UK GDPR&#8221;), which became effective in 2021. In June 2021, the EC published a new set of standard contractual clauses, which only apply to the transfer of personal data outside of the EU to a country not approved by the EU as providing an adequate level of protection for the processing of personal data. The EU's adequacy decision with respect to the UK, which allows the continued flow of personal data from the EU to the UK, will be regularly reviewed and may be revoked if the UK diverges from its current adequate data protection laws. The UK has developed its own international data transfer agreement, which was implemented in March 2022. In June 2023, the EU-US Data Protection Framework came into force, which allows organizations to self-certify their compliance under the framework for data transfers from the EU, UK and Switzerland to the US. GDPR and UK GDPR, as well as other statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection, increase compliance obligations, affect BlackRock&#8217;s collection, processing, retention and transfer of personal data and reporting of personal data security breaches, and provide for increased penalties for non-compliance. 

BlackRock also maintains two offices in the Middle East, one in Dubai, which is regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority, and one in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which is regulated by the Saudi Capital Markets Authority. Both offices are authorized to provide certain investment services and support BlackRock&#8217;s provision of investment products and services in their countries of domicile. Other countries across the Middle Eastern region are serviced on a cross-border basis. 

Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region 

In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (&#8220;FIEA&#8221;) and the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (&#8220;JFSA&#8221;), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEA. This Japanese subsidiary also holds a license for real estate brokerage activities which subjects it to the regulations set forth in the Real Estate Brokerage Act. 

In Australia, BlackRock&#8217;s operating entity is principally regulated under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (&#8220;ASIC&#8221;), which includes holding an Australian financial services license and operating registered managed investment schemes. ASIC is Australia&#8217;s integrated corporate, markets, financial services and consumer credit regulator. 

In New Zealand, certain BlackRock subsidiaries are primarily regulated by the Financial Markets Authority (&#8220;FMA&#8221;). The FMA is responsible for overseeing and enforcing financial markets legislation including the licensing of firms to provide certain financial products and services in New Zealand and administering anti-money laundering and terrorism financing legislation, amongst other functions. 

&#160; 

The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (&#8220;SFO&#8221;), which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (&#8220;SFC&#8221;). The SFC is also empowered to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC. 

BlackRock&#8217;s operations in Taiwan are regulated by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for regulating securities markets (including the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Taiwan Futures Exchange), the banking industry and the insurance sector. 

BlackRock&#8217;s Fund Management Company in China (&#8220;BlackRock FMC&#8221;) is regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and is subject to the Securities Investment Fund Law and Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Mutual Fund Managers for the overall oversight from incorporation to the corporate governance and operations of fund managers and funds. BlackRock FMC is also subject to the China Securities Law and various other financial laws and regulations. BlackRock CCB Wealth Management Limited, which is BlackRock&#8217;s wealth management joint venture company with CCB Wealth Management Co., Ltd. and Fullerton Management Pte Ltd. in China, is regulated by the National Financial Regulatory Administration (&#8220;NFRA&#8221;, formerly known as the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission). They have enacted Bank Wealth Management Supervision and Management Measures and Management Measures of Bank Wealth Management Subsidiaries and other relevant rules to regulate the setup, conduct of business and risk management of bank wealth management companies. 

In Singapore, a BlackRock subsidiary is regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (&#8220;MAS&#8221;) and its business activities are subject to the Securities and Futures Act 2001 (&#8220;SFA&#8221;). The SFA governs the regulation of activities and institutions in the securities and derivatives industry, including fund management, dealing in capital markets products and leveraged foreign exchange trading. The MAS is Singapore&#8217;s central bank and integrated financial regulator, which regulates the financial services sector in Singapore and conducts integrated supervision of financial services and financial stability surveillance. This BlackRock subsidiary and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFA are required to be licensed with the MAS, and are subject to the SFA and the regulations, rules, codes, notices and guidelines issued by the MAS. 

Other financial regulators oversee BlackRock subsidiaries, branches and representative offices across the Asia-Pacific region, including in South Korea. Regulators in all of these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant, suspend or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements.
