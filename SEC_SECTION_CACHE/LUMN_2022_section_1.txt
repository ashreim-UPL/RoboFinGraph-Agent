 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Business Overview and Purpose 

We are an international facilities-based technology and communications company focused on providing our business and residential customers with a broad array of integrated products and services necessary to fully participate in our rapidly evolving digital world, which we believe is undergoing the &#8220;Fourth Industrial Revolution&#8221; or simply the &#8220;4IR.&#8221; We operate one of the world&#8217;s most interconnected networks. Our platform empowers our customers to rapidly adjust digital programs to meet immediate demands, create efficiencies, accelerate market access, and reduce costs &#8211; allowing customers to rapidly evolve their information, communications and technology programs to address dynamic changes. By empowering our customers to rapidly acquire, analyze and act on data, we are enabling our customers to thrive in the 4IR. Our specific products and services are detailed below under the heading &#8220;Segments and Products &#38; Services.&#8221; 

We conduct our operations under the following three brands: 

&#8226; "Lumen," which is our flagship brand for serving the enterprise and wholesale markets 

&#8226; "Quantum Fiber," which is our brand for providing fiber-based services to residential and small business customers 

&#8226; "CenturyLink," which is our long-standing brand for providing mass-marketed legacy copper-based services, managed for optimal cost and efficiency. 

With approximately 190,000 on-net buildings and 500,000 route miles of fiber optic cable globally, we are among the largest providers of communications services to domestic and global enterprise customers. Our terrestrial and subsea fiber optic long-haul network throughout North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific connects to metropolitan fiber networks that we operate. We provide services in over 60 countries, with most of our revenue being derived in the United States ("U.S."). 

As further discussed immediately below under the heading &#8220;Acquisitions and Divestitures,&#8221; during 2022 we plan to sell our Latin American business and a portion of our incumbent local exchange business. 

For a discussion of certain risks applicable to our business, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this report. 

Acquisitions and Divestitures 

Since being incorporated in 1968, we have grown principally through acquisitions. By 2008, we had become one of the largest providers of rural telephone services in the United States. Since then, we acquired Embarq Corporation in mid-2009, Qwest Communications International Inc. in early 2011 and Level 3 Communications, Inc. in late 2017. These acquisitions have substantially changed our customer base, geographic footprint, business strategies and mix of products and services. 

We regularly evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional assets or divesting assets in exchange for cash, securities or other properties, and at any given time may be engaged in discussions or negotiations regarding additional acquisitions or divestitures. We generally do not announce our acquisitions or divestitures until we have entered into a preliminary or definitive agreement. 

Planned Divestitures of the Latin American Business and Incumbent Local Exchange Business 

On July 25, 2021, affiliates of Level 3 Parent, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Lumen Technologies, Inc., entered into a definitive agreement to divest our Latin American business in exchange for $2.7 billion cash, subject to certain working capital, other purchase price adjustments and related transaction expenses. Level 3 Parent, LLC anticipates closing the transaction mid-year 2022, upon receipt of all requisite regulatory approvals in the U.S. and certain countries where the Latin American business operates, as well as the satisfaction of other customary conditions. 

On August 3, 2021, we and certain of our affiliates entered into a definitive agreement to divest our incumbent local exchange ("ILEC") business conducted within 20 Midwestern and Southern states. In exchange, we would receive $7.5 billion, subject to offsets for (i) assumed indebtedness and (ii) our transaction expenses, certain of purchaser&#8217;s transaction expenses, taxes and certain working capital and other customary purchase price adjustments. We anticipate closing the transaction mid-year 2022 upon receipt of all regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. 

See Note 2&#8212;Planned Divestiture of the Latin American and ILEC Businesses to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information on these transactions.

Strategy 

Our over-arching strategic goal is to continue integrating and upgrading our global network and other assets and technologies into an advanced high-bandwidth, low latency platform that is secure, reliable and fast. To attain this goal, we strive to, among other things: 

&#8226; strengthen our digital self-service product ordering platforms; 

&#8226; expand our offering of secure edge computing services; 

&#8226; create a more adaptive network; 

&#8226; expand our network capacity through our Quantum Fiber buildout plan and other initiatives; 

&#8226; return a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and periodic stock repurchases; 

&#8226; monetize our non-core assets and manage our non-fiber business for cash; and 

&#8226; strengthen our financial position and performance through debt paydown and cost reduction efforts. 

Our Stakeholders 

We believe realizing the Lumen promise depends on regular, informed communications with our stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, vendors, lenders, partners and our global community. 

Employees and Human Capital Resources 

Lumen&#8217;s highly competitive business requires attracting, developing and retaining a motivated team inspired by leadership, engaged in meaningful work, motivated by career growth opportunities and thriving in a culture that embraces diversity, inclusion and belonging. Understanding and anticipating the priorities of our current and future employees is important to our future success. At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 36,000 employees world-wide, including approximately 7,000 outside the U.S. 

Attracting, Developing and Retaining Talent 

Our recruiting, development and retention objectives focus on treating talent as a differentiator and a leading indicator of business performance. We strive to hire and retain the best talent available, to be transparent with regards to new career and promotional opportunities, to mitigate bias and to champion fair selection and best hiring practices. Establishing a framework of competency-based success profiles and fostering career progression through regular career development and training empowers our employees to pursue their professional goals and helps to improve employee engagement and retention. We invest in broad-based development for all of our employees in various ways such as skills-building programs, on-demand learning options, tuition reimbursement, tailored mentoring programs and a suite of leadership development courses. In an effort to create more development opportunities for all employees, we are currently enhancing our intern, mentoring and leadership development programs, with added focus on development for diverse employees. 

We believe we have made significant strides in attracting, engaging, and hiring a diverse group of early career employees through our internship program, our numerous sales and operations academies, and our "pathways in technology" program. We have also increased our focus on internal mobility and providing more visibility and career opportunities to our workforce through our internal communications platforms. 

We gauge progress and efficacy, identify opportunities for change, and pursue solutions through tracking and analyzing data from various sources, such as annual talent reviews and measuring our progress toward goals specified in our development, diversity and inclusion plans. 

Diversity, Inclusion &#38; Belonging 

We believe that understanding and respecting another's perspective, experience, background and beliefs provide an opportunity to expand horizons, challenge complacency and foster empathy. For Lumen, we believe diversity of perspective, experience, background and beliefs fuels our innovative, collaborative, and engaged workplace. Realizing greater ethnic, racial and gender diversity across all levels of an organization is, and will continue to be, an ongoing journey. Our Diversity &#38; Inclusion Steering Committee, comprised of a cross-functional team of senior executives and led by our Chief Diversity &#38; Inclusion Officer, regularly evaluates and seeks to define our diversity, inclusion and belonging strategy. We aim for the highest standards of fairness and equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, promotions, job assignments and compensation (including undertaking periodic gender and race/ethnicity pay equity studies of our U.S., non-represented employees and making pay adjustments when warranted). Inclusive recruiting and outreach programs for diverse candidates, employee resource groups, and management-led listening circles are among some of Lumen&#8217;s initiatives to create greater diversity and belonging among our employees. 

Positive Corporate Culture 

Our employees are critical to Lumen's success and we believe creating a positive, inclusive culture is essential to attracting and retaining engaged employees. Lumen&#8217;s company culture program incorporates a wide variety of communication and training activities encouraging collaboration among our colleagues around the world. We measure the program&#8217;s efficacy and identify opportunities for improvements through an engagement survey distributed approximately every six months. 

Health &#38; Wellness 

We believe a healthy, engaged and high performing workforce is part of our competitive advantage. We want all of our employees to thrive, and we regularly re-evaluate how to best support our employees&#8217; wellness, health and safety through benefits and resources. Our current benefit and wellness programs drive engagement that positively impacts our culture, job satisfaction, recruiting and retention programs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded our physical, mental, and family health programs and informational outreach. Additional information about our COVID-19 response is located under Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Item 7 of Part II of this report. 

Labor Relations 

Approximately 21% of our U.S. workforce is represented by a union, either the Communications Workers of America or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Employees in four countries in Europe are represented by works councils or a representative body. We recognize the critical role that our supervisors and managers play in fostering a productive and respectful work environment, and we encourage employees to work directly with their supervisors, where possible, to efficiently and effectively resolve workplace concerns. We also respect our employees&#8217; rights to voluntarily establish and join unions and similar associations without unlawful interference. We strive to work collaboratively with the unions, councils and associations that represent our workers. 

Customer Success 

Our customers range from individual households to global enterprises. Whether our network supports remote education or a multi-national work-from-home environment, all customers are impacted by the quality and reliability of our products and services. Understanding how each customer accesses and uses our products and services informs the type of customer engagement to best meet their expectations. Our Customer Success organization includes dedicated teams focused on building deeper relationships and providing us the opportunity to continually improve our customers&#8217; Lumen experience, including their interactions with our employees and systems. We believe a strong experience leads to satisfied customers and engaged employees who are encouraged to recommend creative solutions. We have a dedicated team responsible for evaluating the best approach to improving the experiences of customers, coupled with frequent, transparent and informative communication processes. 

We value both customer and employee suggestions. We offer our customers several channels for communicating with us, including voice, text, email, chat and social media, among others. We are driving a digital-first culture that allows our customers to configure, order, and rapidly deploy our services through an all-digital, self-service set of tools. Since 2019, we have hosted an annual customer experience (CX) event, during which we invite customers to collaborate directly with us. 

While careful listening to customers is the best source of customer experience feedback, we believe overlaying it with employee feedback is the most effective way to continuously improve. We regularly invite our front-line employees to provide feedback on opportunities to improve our capabilities. 

Partners and Vendors 

Understanding how our customers access and use our products and services is an important element of evaluating which partners and vendors may best contribute to our customers&#8217; success. Lumen leverages our relationships and by co-innovating with a comprehensive group of strategic partners to create solutions focused exclusively on our customers' business and IT requirements. Through our open and interoperable approach, we seek to identify the optimal platform for serving our customers &#8211; whether ours or a third party&#8217;s. When necessary, Lumen incorporates market-leading technologies to optimize application performance and streamline integration throughout the IT stack to ensure seamless integration and interoperability. Lumen has collaborated with a host of technology partners, giving us the capability to tailor and fully manage scalable solutions that customers control. Lumen, by working with our network of technology partners, can integrate different partners and technologies, to improve our products and services. 

In light of these efforts to better serve our customers, we are materially reliant on a wide range of vendors to support our organization and partners to support our strategy. We work with, and rely on, other communications companies that lease us transmission capacity or sell us various services necessary for our current operations, as well as a wide range of software, hardware and equipment suppliers. We believe that co-innovating with other companies provides the flexibility to rapidly evolve our customer offerings. 

Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability 

Environmental stewardship is inherent in our identity. We review the impact of our operations and make choices to reduce our environmental footprint. We believe our commitment to environmental sustainability promotes the financial health of our business, the quality of service we provide and value creation for our employees, communities, customers and investors. Our Environment, Health and Safety ("EHS") team oversees and executes the company&#8217;s EHS and environmental sustainability visions. 

The EHS program framework focuses on seven key areas: 

&#8226; Environmental compliance and management: The Lumen EHS team assesses and reviews our company programs, operational facilities and waste management vendors. We monitor environmental legislative activity and collaborate with other internal groups to develop documented practices and procedures that support compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 

&#8226; Energy and emissions: To reduce our carbon footprint, we are identifying and implementing energy efficiency and greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions reduction initiatives. In January 2021, we were among the very first U.S. companies to issue sustainability-linked bonds. 

&#8226; Water: Lumen uses the World Resource Institute&#8217;s water quality index to assess our operations in drought-stricken areas or areas that have the potential to be in the future. We are working to reduce our consumption of water overall and especially in countries or regions identified as high-risk. 

&#8226; Waste: We aim to reduce our waste through minimization, re-use and recycling. We divert millions of pounds of electronic and communications equipment from landfills each year. We recycle telecommunications equipment, and our modem/router takeback program allows customers to return their equipment, which are then either reused or sent to an R2-certified recycler. 

&#8226; Supplier environmental assessment: We expect our suppliers to demonstrate the same commitment as us to compliance and sustainability efforts. We expect our suppliers to use reasonable efforts to employ environmentally preferred and energy-efficient services, and to work with their own suppliers to assess and address environmental and sustainability issues within their supply chains. 

&#8226; Climate preparedness: We prepare for potential impacts by evaluating various climate change risks to our ongoing operations when we consider opening new facilities and/or expanding our network. Our comprehensive business continuity program focuses on prevention, collaboration, communication, response and recovery to assist us in quickly resolving disruptive events. 

&#8226; Occupational Health and Safety: The EHS team conducts risk assessments and monitors health and safety legislation to develop policies and procedures designed to eliminate or control safety hazards and support compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 

Our Network 

Our network, through which we provide most of our products and services, consists of fiber-optic and copper cables, high-speed transport equipment, electronics, voice switches, data switches and routers, and various other equipment. We operate part of our network with leased assets, and a substantial portion of our equipment with licensed software. 

At December 31, 2021, our global network (owned and leased) included (i) approximately 500,000 route miles of fiber optic plant, including approximately 42,000 route miles of subsea fiber optic cable systems and (ii) multiple gateway and transmission facilities used in connection with operating our network throughout North America, Europe and Latin America. 

At December 31, 2021, our domestic network connected approximately 190,000 on-net buildings, which we refer to as &#8220;Fiber On-net&#8221; buildings, serving our enterprise customer base and approximately 28.6 million broadband-enabled locations serving our Mass Markets customer base. At December 31, 2021, our Mass Markets broadband-enabled locations consisted of 25.8 million copper-based passings and 2.8 million fiber-based passings. It also included at such date central office and other equipment that enables us to provide telephone service as an incumbent local exchange carrier ("ILEC") in 37 states. 

As discussed in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Item 7 of Part II of this report and Note 2&#8212;Planned Divestiture of the Latin American and ILEC Businesses to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report, we have agreed to sell portions of our above-described network during 2022. 

As noted elsewhere in this report, we view our network as one of our most critical assets. We have devoted, and plan to continue to devote, substantial resources to (i) simplify and modernize our network and legacy systems and (ii) expand our network to address demand for enhanced or new products. A key element of our network expansion plan is our Quantum Fiber buildout project. Under this project, we propose over the next several years to construct additional fiber optic infrastructure to enable us to provide Quantum Fiber broadband services to several million additional urban and suburban locations in our ILEC markets. 

Although we own most of our network, we lease a substantial portion of our core fiber network from several other communication companies under arrangements that will periodically need to be renewed or replaced to support our current network operations. 

Like other large communications companies, we are a constant target of cyber-attacks of various degrees, and, from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we experience disruption in our services. We develop and maintain systems and programs designed to protect against cyber-attacks and network outages. The development, maintenance and operation of these systems and programs is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to bypass security measures become more sophisticated and evolve rapidly. 

For additional information regarding our systems, network assets, network risks, capital expenditure requirements and reliance upon third parties, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this report. 

Competition 

We compete in a dynamic and highly competitive market in which demand for high-speed, secure data services continues to grow. We expect continued intense competition from a wide variety of sources under these evolving market conditions. In addition to competition from large international communications providers, we are facing competition from a growing number of sources, including systems integrators, cloud service providers, software networking companies, infrastructure companies, cable companies, device providers, resellers and smaller niche providers. 

Our ability to compete hinges upon effectively enhancing and better integrating our existing products, introducing new products on a timely and cost-effective basis, meeting changing customer needs, providing high-quality information security to build customer confidence and combat cyber-attacks, extending our core technology into new applications and anticipating emerging standards, business models, software delivery methods and other technological changes. Depending on the applicable market and requested services, competition can be intense, especially if competitors in the market have network assets better suited to customer needs, faster transmission speeds or lower prices, or, in certain overseas markets, are national or regional incumbent communications providers that have a longer history of providing service in the market. 

For our traditional voice services, providers of wireless voice, social networking and electronic messaging services are significant competitors as many customers are increasingly relying on these providers to communicate, resulting in the long-term systemic decline we have seen in our legacy, traditional voice services. Other potential sources of competition include non-carrier systems that are capable of bypassing our local networks, either partially or completely, through various means. Developments in software have permitted new competitors to offer affordable networking products that historically required more expensive hardware investment. We anticipate that all these trends will continue to place downward pressures on the use of our voice network. 

Additionally, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 obligates ILECs, including those operated by us, to permit competitors to interconnect their facilities to the ILEC&#8217;s network and to take various other steps that are designed to promote competition, including obligations to (i) negotiate interconnection agreements in good faith, (ii) provide nondiscriminatory &#8220;unbundled&#8221; access to specific portions of the ILEC&#8217;s network and (iii) permit competitors to physically or virtually collocate their plant on the ILEC&#8217;s property. As a result of the above-described regulatory and technological developments, we also face competition from competitive local exchange carriers ("CLECs"), particularly in densely populated areas. CLECs provide competing services through (i) reselling an ILEC&#8217;s local services, (ii) using an ILEC&#8217;s unbundled network elements, (iii) operating their own facilities or (iv) a combination thereof. 

Competition to provide broadband and other data services remains high. Market demand for our broadband services could be adversely affected by advanced wireless data transmission technologies and other systems delivering generally faster average broadband transmission speeds than our legacy copper-based infrastructure. Our network expansion and innovation strategy is focused largely on addressing these competitive pressures. As both residential and business customers increasingly demand high-speed connections for entertainment, communications and productivity, we expect the demands on our network will continue to increase over the next several years. To meet these demands and remain competitive, we are continuing to invest in network capacity, security, reliability, flexibility and design innovations, such as through our Quantum Fiber buildout, to deliver competitive high-speed services. 

We compete to provide services to business customers based on a variety of factors, including the comprehensiveness and reliability of our network, our data transmission speeds, price, the latency of our available network services, the scope of our integrated offerings, the reach and peering capacity of our IP network, and customer service. 

Additional information about competitive pressures is located under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Business Risks&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this report. 

Sales and Marketing 

Market Overview 

Anticipating market trends drives our investment in developing new product and service offerings. We expect edge computing services demand to significantly increase over the next several years in several industries, including finance, healthcare, retail and manufacturing. We also expect secure network services will increase in importance to consumers. We believe we have a comprehensive set of global fiber assets that positions us to deliver a highly-competitive suite of cloud connectivity, low latency edge computing, and integrated network services. 

We generally market our business services to members of in-house IT departments or other highly-sophisticated customers with deep technological experience. These individuals typically satisfy their IT requirements by contracting with us or a rapidly evolving group of competitors, or by deploying in-house solutions. 

Sales Channels 

Our enterprise sales and marketing approach focuses on solving complex customer problems with advanced technology and network solutions - striving to make core networks services compatible with digital tools. We also rely on our call center personnel and a variety of channel partners to promote sales of services that meet the needs of our customers. To meet the needs of different customers, our offerings include both stand-alone services and bundled services designed to provide a complete offering of integrated services. 

Our sales and marketing approach to our business customers includes a commitment to provide comprehensive communications and IT solutions for business, wholesale and government customers of all sizes, ranging from small business offices to the world&#8217;s largest global enterprise customers. Our marketing plans include marketing our products and services primarily through direct sales representatives, inbound call centers, telemarketing and third parties, including telecommunications agents, system integrators, value-added resellers and other telecommunications firms. We support our distribution through digital advertising, events, television advertising, website promotions and public relations. We maintain local offices in most major and secondary markets within the U.S. and many of the primary markets of the more than 60 countries in which we provide services. 

Similarly, our sales and marketing approach to our mass market customers emphasizes customer-oriented sales, marketing and service with a local presence. Our approach includes marketing our products and services primarily through direct sales representatives, inbound call centers, telemarketing and third parties, including retailers, satellite television providers, door to door sales agents and digital marketing firms. 

Segments and Products &#38; Services 

We completed an internal reorganization in January 2021 to adjust our reporting segments and customer-facing sales channels to better align with operational changes designed to better support our customers. We believe the changes provide greater transparency into how we are performing against our strategy, including focusing on growth opportunities and managing declining legacy services. 

Segments 

We report our financial performance using two segments, as described below: 

&#8226; Business Segment: Under our Business segment, we provide our products and services under four sales channels to meet the needs of our enterprise and commercial customers; and 

&#8226; Mass Markets Segment: Under our Mass Markets segment, we provide products and services to consumer and small business customers. 

The following table shows the composition of our operating revenue by segment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019: 

##TABLE_START &#160; Years Ended December 31, Percent Change &#160; 2021 2020 2019 2021 vs 2020 2020 vs 2019 Percentage of revenue: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Business 72 % 72 % 71 % &#8212; % 1 % Mass Markets 28 % 28 % 29 % &#8212; % (1) % Total operating revenue 100 % 100 % 100 % &#160; ##TABLE_END

As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 2,800 patents and patent applications in the U.S. and other countries. We have also received licenses to use patents held by others. Patent licenses give us the freedom to operate our business without the risk of interruption from the holder of the patented technology. We plan to continue to file new patent applications as we enhance and develop products and services, and we plan to continue to seek opportunities to expand our patent portfolio through strategic acquisitions and licensing. 

In addition to our patent rights, we have rights in various trade names, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property that we use to conduct our business. Our services often use the intellectual property of others, including licensed software. We also occasionally license our intellectual property to others as we deem appropriate. 

For information on various litigation risks associated with owning and using intellectual property rights, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Business Risks&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this report, and Note 18&#8212;Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report. 

Regulation of Our Business 

Our domestic operations are regulated by the FCC, by various state regulatory commissions and occasionally by local agencies. Our non-domestic operations are regulated by supranational groups (such as the European Union, or EU), national agencies and frequently state, provincial or local bodies. Generally, we must obtain and maintain operating licenses from these bodies in most areas where we offer regulated services. For information on the risks associated with the regulations discussed below, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Legal and Regulatory Risks&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this report. 

Changes in the composition and leadership of the FCC, state regulatory commissions and other agencies that regulate our business could have significant impacts on our revenue, expenses, competitive position and prospects. Changes in the composition and leadership of these agencies are often difficult to predict, which makes future planning more difficult. The following description discusses some of the major regulations affecting our operations, but others could have a substantial impact on us as well. For additional information, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A of Part I of this report. 

Federal Regulation of Domestic Operations 

General 

The FCC regulates the interstate services we provide, including the business data service charges we bill for wholesale network transmission and intercarrier compensation, including the interstate access charges that we bill other communications companies in connection with the origination and termination of interstate phone calls. Additionally, the FCC regulates several aspects of our business related to international communications services, privacy, public safety and network infrastructure, including (i) our access to and use of local telephone numbers, (ii) our provision of emergency 911 services and (iii) our use or removal (potentially on a reimbursable basis) of equipment produced by certain vendors deemed to cause potential national security risks. We could incur substantial penalties if we fail to comply with the FCC&#8217;s applicable regulations. 

Many of the FCC&#8217;s regulations adopted in recent years remain subject to judicial review and additional rulemakings, thus increasing the difficulty of determining the ultimate impact of these changes on us and our competitors. 

Universal Service 

In 2015, we accepted CAF funding from the FCC of approximately $500 million per year for six years to fund the deployment of voice and broadband capable infrastructure for approximately 1.2 million rural households and businesses in 33 of the 37 states in which we then operated as an ILEC under the CAF Phase II high-cost support program. As a result of accepting CAF Phase II support payments for 33 states, as well as existing merger-related commitments, we were obligated to make substantial capital expenditures to build infrastructure by certain specified milestone deadlines. In accordance with the FCC&#8217;s January 2020 order, we elected to receive an additional year of CAF Phase II funding in the end of 2021. 

In early 2020, the FCC created the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (the &#8220;RDOF&#8221;), which is a new federal support program designed to replace the CAF Phase II program. On December 7, 2020, the FCC allocated in its RDOF Phase I auction $9.2 billion in support payments over 10 years to deploy high speed broadband to over 5.2 million unserved locations. We won bids for RDOF Phase I support payments of $26 million, annually. We expect our support payments under the RDOF Phase I program will begin soon after our anticipated receipt of the FCC's approval of our pending application. Assuming we timely complete our pending divestiture of the ILEC business on the terms described herein, we expect a portion of these payments will accrue to the purchaser of that business. See Note 2&#8212;Planned Divestiture of the Latin American and ILEC Businesses to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for additional information. 

For additional information about the potential financial impact of the CAF Phase II program, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of Part II of this report. 

Broadband Regulation 

In February 2015, the FCC adopted an order classifying broadband internet access services (&#8220;BIAS&#8221;) under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 and applying new regulations. In December 2017, the FCC voted to repeal the classification of BIAS as a Title II service and to preempt states from imposing substantial regulations on broadband. Opponents of this change appealed this action in federal court. Several states have also opposed the change and have proposed, implemented or enacted laws or orders focused on state-specific Internet service regulation. In October 2019, the federal court upheld the FCC&#8217;s classification decision but vacated a part of its preemption ruling. Various courts are considering or have ruled upon the issue of the enforceability of state broadband regulation, and additional litigation and appeals are expected with respect to this issue. In addition, members of the Biden Administration and various consumer interest groups have advocated in favor of reclassifying BIAS under Title II. The ultimate impact of these pending judicial matters and calls for additional regulation are currently unknown to us, although the imposition of heightened regulation of our Internet operations could potentially hamper our ability to operate our data networks efficiently, restrict our ability to implement network management practices necessary to ensure quality service, increase the cost of operating, maintaining and upgrading our network and otherwise negatively impact our current operations. 

State Regulation of Domestic Operations 

Historically ILECs, including ours, have been regulated as &#8220;common carriers,&#8221; and state regulatory commissions have generally exercised jurisdiction over intrastate voice telecommunications services and their associated facilities. In recent years, most states have reduced their regulation of ILECs. State regulatory commissions generally continue to (i) set the rates that telecommunications companies charge each other for exchanging traffic, (ii) administer support programs designed to subsidize the provision of services to high-cost rural areas, (iii) regulate the purchase and sale of ILECs, (iv) require ILECs to provide service under publicly-filed tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices of regulated services, (v) limit ILECs&#8217; ability to borrow and pledge their assets, (vi) regulate transactions between ILECs and their affiliates and (vii) impose various other service standards. In most states, switched and business data services and interconnection services are subject to price regulation, although the extent of regulation varies by type of service and geographic region. In addition, our Voice-Over-Internet Protocol services are regulated more lightly than legacy telephone services. 

Data Privacy Regulations 

Various foreign, federal and state laws govern our storage, maintenance and use of customer data, including a wide range of consumer protection, data protection, privacy, intellectual property and similar laws. Data privacy regulations are complex and vary across jurisdictions. As a global company, we must comply with various jurisdictional data privacy regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) in the EU and similar laws adopted by various other jurisdictions in certain of our domestic and overseas markets. The application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws are often uncertain, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. These regulations require careful handling of personal and customer data and could have a significant impact on our business. We have adopted data handling policies and practices to comply with global data privacy requirements, including GDPR and similar regulations. 

Anti-Bribery and Corruption Regulations 

As a global company we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations governing business ethics and practices, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and anti-competition regulations. We have compliance policies, programs and training to prevent non-compliance with such anti-corruption regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. 

International Regulations 

Our subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. are subject to various regulations in the markets where service is provided. The scope of regulation varies from country to country. The communications regulatory regimes in certain of our non-domestic markets are in the process of development. Many issues, including the pricing of services, have not been addressed fully, or even at all. 

The United Kingdom (&#8220;UK&#8221;) recently terminated its membership in the EU (&#8220;Brexit&#8221;) and has entered into related separation agreements with the EU regarding data sharing, financial services and other matters. Several factors which are currently unknown will influence Brexit&#8217;s ultimate impact on our business. We operate a staging facility in the UK, where certain core network elements and customer premises equipment is configured before being shipped to both UK and EU locations. The UK is currently also a central repository of our spare parts for use in our European operations. However, we have also established a third party sparing facility in Amsterdam which we believe will help mitigate potential disruptions resulting from any impediments to the free movement of goods between the EU and the UK. Given the small percentage of our global personnel that are UK or EU nationals, we do not anticipate any adverse impact from Brexit on our workforce. We are currently monitoring Brexit developments, reviewing our supply chain alternatives, and assessing the short and long-term implications of Brexit on our operations. Nonetheless, based on current information, we do not anticipate Brexit will have a substantial impact on our business. 

Our overseas operations are subject to various U.S. export and sanctions laws and regulations. Our deconsolidated Venezuelan affiliate conducts operations in Venezuela, which is currently subject to certain U.S. sanctions. 

Other Regulations 

Our networks and properties are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations governing the use, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, the release of pollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination. Our contingent liabilities under these laws are further described in Note 18&#8212;Commitments, Contingencies and Other Items. Certain federal and state agencies, including attorneys general, monitor and exercise oversight related to consumer protection issues. We are also subject to codes that regulate our trenching and construction operations or that require us to obtain permits, licenses or franchises to operate. Such regulations are enacted by municipalities, counties, state, federal or other regional governmental bodies, and can vary widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as a result. Such regulations may also require us to pay substantial fees. 

Seasonality 

Overall, our business is not materially impacted by seasonality. Our network-related operating expenses are, however, generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year. From time to time, weather related problems have resulted in increased costs to repair our network and respond to service calls in some of our markets. The amount and timing of these costs are subject to the weather patterns of any given year but have generally been highest during the third quarter and have been related to damage from severe storms, including hurricanes, tropical storms and tornadoes in our markets along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coastlines. 

Additional Information 

From time to time, we may make investments in other communications or technology companies. For further information on regulatory, technological and competitive factors that could impact our revenue, see "Regulation" under this Item 1, above, and "Competition" under this Item 1, above, and "Risk Factors" under Item 1A, below.
