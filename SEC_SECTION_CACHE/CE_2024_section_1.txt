&#8226; Key Products 

Acetyl Products. Acetyl products include acetic acid, VAM, acetic anhydride and acetate esters. Acetic acid is primarily used to manufacture VAM, purified terephthalic acid and other acetyl derivatives. VAM is used in a variety of adhesives, paints, films, coatings and textiles. Acetic anhydride is a raw material used in the production of cellulose acetate, detergents and pharmaceuticals. Acetate esters are used in solvents for ink formulations, surface coatings, adhesives and pharmaceutical industries. We manufacture acetic acid, VAM and acetic anhydride for our own use in producing downstream, value-added products, as well as for sale to third parties. 

Acetic acid and VAM leverage global supply and demand fundamentals. The principal raw materials in these products are carbon monoxide, methanol and ethylene. We generally purchase carbon monoxide under long-term contracts, and we also produce carbon monoxide in our Clear Lake facility. We generally purchase methanol and ethylene under both annual and multi-year contracts. Methanol and ethylene are commodity products and generally available from a wide variety of sources, while carbon monoxide is typically purpose-made in close proximity. 

We have a joint venture, Fairway Methanol LLC ("Fairway"), with Mitsui, in which we own a 50% interest, for the production of methanol at our integrated chemical plant in Clear Lake, Texas. The methanol unit utilizes natural gas in the U.S. Gulf Coast region as a feedstock. Almost all of our North American methanol needs are met from our share of the production, as well as the long-term contract we have with our joint venture partner, Mitsui. 

In December 2023, we began carbon capture and utilization ("CCU") operations at our Clear Lake site as part of our Fairway joint venture. The unit is expected to capture CO2 industrial emissions and produce low-carbon methanol which will help our global customers meet the growing demand for more sustainable and circular solutions. The products will be launched under the ECO-CC name and be supported through third-party mass balance tracking and life cycle assessment processes. 

Solvents and Derivatives. We manufacture a variety of solvents, formaldehyde and other chemicals, which in turn are used in the manufacture of paints, coatings, adhesives and other products. Many solvents and derivatives products are derived from our production of acetic acid. Primary products are: 

&#8226; Ethyl acetate, an acetate ester that is a solvent used in coatings, inks and adhesives; 

&#8226; Butyl acetate, an acetate ester that is a solvent used in inks, pharmaceuticals and perfume; and 

&#8226; Formaldehyde and paraformaldehyde, which are primarily used to produce adhesive resins for plywood, particle board, coatings, POM engineering resins and a compound used in making polyurethane. 

Emulsion Polymers. Our emulsion polymers business produces conventional vinyl- and acrylate-based emulsions and VAE emulsions. VAE emulsions are a key component of water-based architectural coatings, adhesives, non-wovens, textiles, glass fiber and other applications. VAE emulsions are in high demand in Europe and Asia as they enable low volatile organic compound paints, specifically in interior paints. 

EVA Polymers. Our EVA polymers business produces low-density polyethylene, EVA resins and compounds. Low-density polyethylene is produced in high-pressure reactors from ethylene, while EVA resins and compounds are produced in high-pressure reactors from ethylene and VAM. 

Redispersible Powders . Our RDP business uses a number of emulsions in manufacturing redispersible powders to meet requirements for various applications and formulated to fit our customers' needs for optimal production. 

Acetate tow and acetate flake . Acetate tow is a fiber used primarily in cigarette filters. In order to produce acetate tow, we first produce acetate flake by processing wood pulp with acetic acid and acetic anhydride. Wood pulp generally comes from reforested trees and is purchased externally from a variety of sources, and acetic anhydride is an intermediate chemical that we produce from acetic acid in our intermediate chemistry business. Acetate flake is then further processed into acetate tow. 

&#8226; Customers 

Our acetyl chain business sells its products both directly to customers and through distributors. Acetic acid, VAM, acetate esters and acetic anhydride are global businesses, and we generally supply our customers under a mix of short- and long-term agreements. Acetic acid, VAM and acetic anhydride customers produce intermediate chemicals and polymers used in water-based paints, adhesives, paper coatings, polyesters, film modifiers, pharmaceuticals, cellulose acetate and textiles. We have long-standing relationships with most of these customers. Solvents and derivatives are sold to a diverse group of regional and multinational customers under multi-year contracts and on the basis of long-standing relationships. Solvents and derivatives customers are primarily engaged in the production of paints, coatings and adhesives. We manufacture formaldehyde for our own use as well as for sale to a few regional customers. 

Emulsion, RDP and EVA polymers products are sold to a diverse group of regional, family owned and multinational customers. Customers of our emulsion polymers and RDP business are manufacturers of water-based paints and coatings, adhesives, paper, building and construction products, glass fiber, non-wovens, textiles and premixed dry mortars. Customers of our EVA polymers business are engaged in the manufacture of a variety of products, including hot melt adhesives, automotive components, thermal laminations, and flexible and food packaging materials. 

Acetate tow is sold principally to the major tobacco companies that account for a majority of worldwide cigarette production. Many sales are conducted under contracts with pricing for one or more years. As a result, margins may expand or contract in response to changes in market conditions over these similar periods, and we may be unable to adjust pricing due to other factors, such as the intense level of competition in the industry. 

Pricing of our products within the Acetyl Chain segment is influenced by industry utilization, changes in the cost of raw materials, sensitivity to demand and the value-in-use. Therefore, in general, there is a direct correlation between these factors and our net sales for most Acetyl Chain products. This impact to pricing typically lags changes in raw material costs over months or quarters and impacts profit margins over those periods. 

See Note 22 - Revenue Recognition in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information.

National Methanol Company. National Methanol Company ("Ibn Sina") is one of the world's largest producers of methyl tertiary-butyl ether, a gasoline additive. Its production facilities are located in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Basic Industries Corporation ("SABIC") is responsible for all product marketing. Methanol is a key feedstock for POM production and is produced by our Ibn Sina affiliate which provides an economic hedge against raw material costs in our engineered materials business. 

Nutrinova Netherlands B.V. Nutrinova Netherlands B.V. ("Nutrinova") is a producer of Sunett &#174; acesulfame potassium (Ace-K) and Nutrinova &#174; sorbates, which are used to improve the safety, shelf-life and taste of its customers' products including food and beverages, personal care, pet food, household cleaning products and pharmaceutical products. 

Korea Engineering Plastics Co., Ltd. Korea Engineering Plastics Co., Ltd. ("KEPCO") is a leading producer of POM in South Korea. KEPCO has polyacetal production facilities in Ulsan, South Korea, compounding facilities for PBT and nylon in Pyongtaek, South Korea, and participates with Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Company, Inc. in a world-scale POM facility in Nantong, China. In December 2020, we signed a memorandum of understanding with our joint venture partners to restructure KEPCO, in which we and our joint venture partners will receive exclusive offtake rights to POM in Asia and global marketing rights without restrictions. In April 2022, we completed the joint venture restructuring of KEPCO. As part of the restructuring of KEPCO, we paid KEPCO $5 million and will have paid 5 equal annual installments of &#8364;24 million on October 1 of each year from 2022 to 2026. This resulted in an increase to our investment in KEPCO of $134 million. Our joint venture partner has made and will make similar payments to KEPCO. The restructuring did not result in a change in ownership percentage of KEPCO, nor a change in control, and KEPCO will continue to be accounted for as an equity method investment. 

Fortron Industries, LLC. Fortron Industries, LLC ("Fortron") is a global producer of PPS, sold under the Fortron &#174; brand, which is used in a wide variety of automotive and other applications, especially those requiring heat and/or chemical resistance. Fortron's facility is located in Wilmington, North Carolina.

Acetyl Chain strategic ventures. Our Acetyl Chain ventures generally fund their operations using operating cash flow and pay dividends based on each ventures' performance in the preceding year. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, we received cash dividends of $125 million, $132 million and $146 million, respectively. 

Although our ownership interest in each of our Acetyl Chain ventures exceeds 20%, we account for these investments at cost after considering observable price changes for similar instruments, minus impairment, if any, because we determined that we cannot exercise significant influence over these entities due to local government investment in and influence over these entities, limitations on our involvement in the day-to-day operations and the present inability of the entities to provide timely financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Further, these investments were determined not to have a readily determinable fair value. 

Other Equity Method Investments 

InfraServs. We hold indirect ownership interests in several German InfraServ Groups that own and develop industrial parks and provide various technical and administrative services to tenants. Our ownership interest in the equity investments in InfraServ affiliates are as follows:

Environmental and Other Regulation 

Matters pertaining to environmental and other regulations are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors , as well as Note 2 - Summary of Accounting Policies , Note 13 - Environmental and Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

We expect to incur approximately $50 million to $70 million in capital expenditures for environmental control measures in each of 2024 and 2025. 

Climate Change 

Climate change is one of the most challenging and significant issues facing the world today, and we seek to do our part to make sustainable progress toward addressing this challenge. 

The nature of our operations is energy and fossil fuel intensive. We have therefore invested in capital projects to increase energy efficiency, improve reliability, recover and reuse waste heat, and increase our purchase of renewable energy as well as more sustainable raw materials. These include a combined heat and power unit at our Lanaken, Belgium facility, a waste-to- 

energy system in Nanjing, China, using solar energy at our Clear Lake, Texas facility designed for use by us and our onsite industrial partners, and a carbon dioxide capture and conversion to methanol project at our Clear Lake, Texas facility. 

We are focused on developing products to help our customers meet their sustainability goals. Examples include products for improving the sustainability of building and construction materials, adhesives, fiber coatings, flexible packaging, vehicle lightweighting and powering electric vehicles. We are also focused on making our own products from more sustainable sources, including increasing our offering products using biocertified content or recycled feedstocks. We believe these capabilities, together with trends such as the automobile industry's commitment towards improved energy efficiency and clean energy, present market opportunities for us. 

With the fourth quarter 2023 publication of our 2022-2023 Sustainability Report, we have reported gross Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions for 2021 and 2022 using The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard , as a guide. Updated 2023 emissions figures were not available at the time of this Form 10-K filing. We have also announced a Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction target described in our 2022-2023 Sustainability Report, obtained limited external assurance on our 2021 and 2022 environmental metrics, and are working to better understand where we can further reduce our GHG emissions sources and to continue to integrate the M&#38;M Business into our GHG measurement and reporting processes. 

For information on the risks we face related to climate change and other sustainability matters as well as, potential legislative and regulatory developments in this area that may increase our operating costs, potentially significantly, please see the risk factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors titled "We are subject to financial, regulatory, physical and transition risks associated with climate change or other sustainability matters as well as potential legislation, regulation and international accords to address climate change and other sustainability matters," "Changes in environmental, health and safety regulations in the jurisdictions where we manufacture or sell our products could lead to a decrease in demand for or significant restrictions on use and/or production of our products and raw materials" and "Our aspirations, goals, and initiatives related to sustainability, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to risks." Climate-related regulatory risks are assessed as a part of our Enterprise Risk Management process. However, due to the level of uncertainty regarding what legislative or regulatory requirements may be enacted, it is not possible for us to estimate the impact of climate-related developments on our results of operations or financial conditions. 

Human Capital Resources 

Workforce Composition and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 

Our business is operated by a diverse and global workforce, with employees in the following key geographies: 

##TABLE_START Employees as of December 31, 2023 North America U.S. 4,248 Other North America 709 Total 4,957 &#160; Europe Germany 1,918 Other Europe 2,597 Total 4,515 &#160; Asia China 1,785 Other Asia 1,057 Total 2,842 &#160; Rest of World 96 &#160; Total 12,410 &#160; ##TABLE_END

We believe that providing a workplace that promotes mutual respect and inclusion for all employees is critical to our success and to driving innovation and growth. To that end, we continue to make progress in our efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in our Company. In order to enhance our visibility to a diverse pipeline of talent and broaden our candidate pool, we engage with historically black colleges and universities ("HBCUs"), trade associations and other professional groups. We also promote engagement globally through 68 chapters of nine different Employee Resource Groups designed to inspire, develop and increase the representation and engagement of underrepresented groups. 

As of December 31, 2023: 

&#8226; globally, women represent approximately 33% of our senior leadership team and 26% of our overall workforce; and 

&#8226; in the U.S., people of color represent approximately 11% of our senior leadership team and 28% of our overall workforce. 

The following shows our attrition rate for the year ended December 31, 2023:

Stewardship: Health, Safety and Environmental 

We focus on more than the occupational health and safety of our employees, contractors and any visitors to our sites. We have an expanded view and measurement of "Stewardship" that includes process safety and environmental events since these incidents may have an impact on our communities. Our Stewardship values and guiding principles are centered on a commitment to do no harm to our workforce, environment, people or communities. 

Achieving and maintaining stewardship excellence is a process of continuous improvement. Our values include a commitment to the health and safety of our employees, contractors, communities and the environment. 

We utilize a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the Stewardship performance of our operations. Lagging indicators for occupational health and safety include Total Recordable Incident Rate ("TRIR") and Lost Time Incident Rate ("LTIR") based upon the number of incidents per 200,000 work hours of both employees and contractors. Process Safety lagging indicators follow the industry standard from API RP 754 for Tier 1 and Tier 2 events for incident count, rate, and severity. In 2023, the criteria for tracking release to the environment was enhanced to a criteria that includes impact to the community and notification to a regulatory authority outside of routine communications. 

Examples of Stewardship Tier 3 leading indicators include reporting and resolution of near miss events and high potential events, losses of primary containment releases and challenges to process safety systems. 

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had a TRIR of 0.11 and an LTIR of 0.03. Through deliberate actions and intentions to understand and recognize our employees' contributions to stewardship excellence, we have reduced our TRIR rate by 58% from 2022. 

Rounding out our Stewardship performance in 2023, we had 5 Tier 1 and Tier 2 process safety incidents and 5 environmental incidents. Any other loss of primary containment incidents, challenges to pressure relief systems, safety instrumented systems and safe operating limits are tracked as Tier 3 leading indicators. Our expanded tracking of leading indicator events helps identify potential emerging deficiencies that enables us to take continuous improvement actions. For example, this past year we concentrated heavily on improving our hazard identification and risk assessment and migration systems, which included expanding these concepts beyond process safety. We are also working to strengthen and fully integrate our stewardship management systems and developing new ways to establish and maintain an effective stewardship culture in a changing and evolving world around us so that all members of our workforce understand and act on their responsibilities seriously, leaders lead, and the entire workforce is fully involved and engaged. We continue to strive to create a workplace where every worker can return home safely every day. 

Talent Development 

We are committed to fostering an engaging and inclusive workplace with opportunities for collaboration, development and leadership. Our Talent Management strategies provide a consistent and efficient approach to how we acquire talent, manage performance, develop bench strength, support development and help employees reach their fullest potential. 

We have a structured approach to reviewing talent with management, as well as with the Board of Directors. This includes discussions of employee development, executive succession, diversity, talent pipelines and workforce planning requirements. We regularly report to the Board of Directors on talent management strategies across functional areas, and annually review executive succession with the Board of Directors.
