In 2023, Mastercard generated $11.98 billion in operating cash flow, reflecting strong core profitability driven by increased net income and non-cash adjustments. Investing activities used $1.35 billion, primarily due to fewer acquisitions and increased investments in time deposits, indicating prudent capital deployment. Financing activities consumed $9.49 billion, mainly from share repurchases ($9 billion) and dividend payments ($2.2 billion), partially offset by debt issuance proceeds. Compared to prior years, operating cash flow increased modestly, while investing and financing outflows decreased, suggesting improved liquidity management and a focus on returning value to shareholders. Mastercardâ€™s robust cash position ($9.2 billion at year-end) and disciplined capital allocation support ongoing growth initiatives and dividend payments, though high share repurchase levels and debt obligations highlight the importance of maintaining liquidity amid potential market or regulatory challenges.
