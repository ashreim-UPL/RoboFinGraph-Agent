**Engineered Materials**  
The Engineered Materials segment reported a 52.8% increase in net sales to $6,149 million in 2023, driven by higher volumes from the M&M acquisition and KEPCO restructuring, partially offset by lower product prices and demand in Western markets. Operating profit surged 152.4% to $1,083 million, aided by a $515 million gain from Nutrinova joint venture formation and reduced raw material costs. Strategic partnership with Mitsui in Nutrinova enhanced product diversification and growth, contributing to income growth. Product innovations, including new liquid crystal polymer (LCP) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMW-PE) plants, improved manufacturing efficiency and market competitiveness. Market share gains in Asia due to increased demand offset declines elsewhere, but geopolitical tensions and demand destocking challenge profitability. Operational costs rose from capacity expansions, while investments in sustainable production (e.g., carbon capture methanol) support future growth. Overall, the segment’s strategic partnerships and product innovations have significantly boosted revenue and profit, positioning it as a key growth driver amid volatile market dynamics.

**Acetyl Chain**  
The Acetyl Chain segment’s net sales declined 15.0% to $4,884 million in 2023, mainly due to lower product prices and demand reductions in vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) and emulsion polymers in Western markets, despite demand increases in Asia. Operating profit fell 23.4% to $1,109 million, primarily from decreased sales and unfavorable market conditions, although sourcing costs for ethylene, methanol, and acid decreased. The segment’s strategic focus on capacity expansion, including a new acetic acid plant in Texas, aims to enhance future competitiveness. Product innovation efforts in acetate tow and demand shifts in key regions influence market share, with Asia showing demand growth while Western markets face declines. Market volatility, driven by policy shifts and raw material price reversion, constrains profit margins. Operational costs from capacity expansions and product mix adjustments impact profitability, but ongoing investments in new facilities and product diversification are expected to support long-term growth despite current challenges.

**Other Activities**  
The Other Activities segment experienced a $7 million operating loss in 2023, slightly worse than 2022, mainly due to increased site and employee costs from the M&M acquisition, partially offset by lower M&A project spending and favorable currency effects. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses increased $86 million, driven by higher interest costs and lower expected returns on plan assets. The segment’s cost structure reflects integration expenses and pension liabilities, with market risks from interest rate fluctuations and currency movements influencing future costs. The segment’s strategic focus on cost management and integration efficiencies aims to mitigate profit challenges, but elevated pension expenses and operational costs from recent acquisitions continue to pressure profitability. Overall, the segment’s financial performance remains constrained by increased benefit obligations and integration costs, requiring ongoing cost controls and strategic adjustments.

**Summary**  
Celanese’s segments demonstrate a strategic focus on growth through acquisitions, product innovation, and sustainable production, with Engineered Materials leading in revenue and profit growth driven by partnerships like Mitsui’s Nutrinova joint venture. Market dynamics, geopolitical tensions, and raw material costs influence profitability, while capacity expansions and technological innovations aim to offset market volatility. Operational costs from capacity and integration efforts impact margins, but strategic alliances and product diversification position the company for long-term resilience amid challenging market conditions.
