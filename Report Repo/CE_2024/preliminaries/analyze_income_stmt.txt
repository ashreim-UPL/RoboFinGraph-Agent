**Revenue Trends:** Celanese reported a FY2023 revenue of $10.94 billion, up 13% from $9.67 billion in 2022, driven primarily by volume increases (+23%) across segments, notably Engineered Materials (+54%) and Acetyl Chain (+2%), despite a 10% decline in overall prices. **Cost Control & Margins:** The gross profit improved modestly to $2.60 billion from $2.38 billion, with gross margins expanding slightly to 23.8%, indicating some cost efficiencies amid raw material cost fluctuations. Operating profit rose 22% to $1.69 billion, reflecting higher sales and a $515 million gain from the Nutrinova joint venture, though operating margins remain healthy at 15.4%. **Profitability & EPS:** Net income of $1.52 billion (EPS: -13.93 in FY2024) shows a significant turnaround from prior losses, but the negative EPS highlights ongoing profitability pressures. Overall, Celanese demonstrates resilient revenue growth and margin stability, though margin pressures and high leverage pose operational challenges.
