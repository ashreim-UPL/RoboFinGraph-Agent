In FY 2023, Celanese's total assets stood at $22.86 billion, with current assets of $5.15 billion and non-current assets of $17.71 billion, indicating a solid asset base. Current liabilities of $3.85 billion compare favorably to current assets, reflecting strong liquidity, though slightly below FY 2022 levels ($6.02 billion in current assets vs. $4.07 billion in current liabilities). Long-term debt decreased to $12.3 billion from $13.37 billion in 2022, improving solvency ratios. Shareholders' equity of $5.17 billion, alongside a net debt of $11.99 billion, suggests moderate leverage. The company's asset management appears efficient, with a stable capital structure supporting future growth, though high leverage warrants cautious monitoring of debt levels relative to cash flow and profitability trends.
