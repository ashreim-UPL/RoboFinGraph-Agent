In 2023, Celanese generated $1.9 billion from operating activities, driven by favorable working capital management and non-trade receivables, indicating strong core profitability. Investing cash flow was minimal at $134 million, reflecting disciplined capital expenditures of $568 million focused on growth projects, with no share repurchases. Financing activities resulted in a net outflow of $1.5 billion, primarily due to debt repayments, including the full repayment of short-term loans and proceeds from new debt issuance to fund the M&A and bond offerings. Compared to prior periods, the companyâ€™s cash flow stability appears solid, supported by substantial liquidity ($1.8 billion cash and equivalents) and manageable debt levels. This suggests effective cash management, though high leverage and significant debt service obligations pose potential liquidity risks if operating cash flows decline. Overall, Celanese maintains a healthy liquidity position with strategic investments, but must monitor debt levels to sustain future growth.
