Virtu’s 2024 financial performance is highlighted by strong revenue growth and improved profitability alongside disciplined cost management. The company’s total revenue increased by 25.4% to $2.88 billion with trading income and commissions driving gains, while operating expenses rose modestly by 13.4%. Profitability was boosted with a net income margin of 18.6% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 57.5%, and diluted EPS more than doubled. On the balance sheet, a robust asset base of $15.36 billion supports a healthy short-term liquidity position given current assets of $2.17 billion against liabilities of $1.76 billion. Although shareholders’ equity improved slightly, a significant increase in net debt highlights heightened leverage resulting from refinancing and new issuances, underlining the need for prudent financial management.
