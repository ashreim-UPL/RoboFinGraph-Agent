In 2022, Amazon generated $46.8 billion from operating activities, reflecting strong core business profitability despite a slight increase from 2021. Investing outflows of $37.6 billion primarily stemmed from capital expenditures supporting technology infrastructure and fulfillment capacity, indicating ongoing strategic investments. Financing inflows of $9.7 billion, driven by debt issuance, and outflows of $53 billion from debt repayment and stock repurchases highlight active capital management. The company's consistent operating cash flow coupled with substantial cash reserves ($70 billion in marketable securities) suggests robust liquidity and effective cash management. However, increased debt levels and high capital expenditures pose potential liquidity and leverage risks. Overall, Amazon maintains a solid liquidity position, with strategic investments supporting future growth, though careful debt and cash flow management will be crucial to mitigate financial challenges.
