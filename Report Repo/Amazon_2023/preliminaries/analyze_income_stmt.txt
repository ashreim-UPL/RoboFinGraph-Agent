**Revenue Growth & Sources:** Amazon reported $514 billion in revenue for FY 2024, a 12.8% increase from $469.8 billion in FY 2023, driven primarily by a 29% rise in AWS sales ($80.1B vs. $62.2B) and a 13% growth in North America retail ($315.9B vs. $279.8B). International sales declined 8% due to currency impacts, but unit sales remained strong.  
**Cost Control & Margins:** Cost of revenue rose 6% to $288.8B, slightly outpacing revenue growth, leading to a gross profit of $226.2B (44% margin), down from 57.5% in FY 2023, indicating margin compression amid rising shipping and fulfillment costs. Operating expenses increased 13%, impacting operating income, which halved to $12.2B from $24.9B.  
**Profitability & EPS:** Net income stood at $59.2B, with EPS of $5.66 (diluted $5.53), reflecting robust profitability despite margin pressures. The net income margin (~11.5%) remains healthy but shows a decline from previous years, highlighting operational challenges.  
**Strategic Outlook:** While revenue growth remains strong, margin compression and increased operating costs suggest a need for efficiency improvements. Continued AWS expansion and unit sales growth underpin long-term prospects, but cost management will be critical to sustain profitability.
