Amazon’s valuation is supported by robust revenue growth, particularly from AWS and North America retail, despite international headwinds. The company’s gross profit margin compressed to 44% due to rising fulfillment and shipping costs, and operating income halved, reflecting increased operating expenses. However, net income remains strong at $59.2 billion, with a healthy net margin of 11.5%, though slightly down from prior years. The balance sheet shows total assets of $624.9 billion and shareholders’ equity of $286 billion, with a current ratio of 1.06 and moderate leverage. Amazon’s stable capital structure, efficient asset management, and substantial equity base provide a solid foundation for future growth, though ongoing cost control will be essential to sustain profitability and support its premium valuation.
