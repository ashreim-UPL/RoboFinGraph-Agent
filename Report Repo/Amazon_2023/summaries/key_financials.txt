Amazon’s FY 2024 financials highlight strong revenue growth, with sales reaching $514 billion, up 12.8 percent year-over-year, fueled by significant gains in AWS and North America retail. Despite this, international sales faced headwinds from currency fluctuations. Rising costs, particularly in shipping and fulfillment, led to margin compression, with gross margin dropping to 44 percent and operating income halving to $12.2 billion. Net income remained robust at $59.2 billion, though profitability margins declined, reflecting operational pressures. The balance sheet shows total assets of $624.9 billion and a current ratio above 1, indicating solid liquidity. Amazon’s prudent leverage and substantial equity base support ongoing investments. Strong operating cash flow and liquidity underpin its financial stability, but managing rising costs and debt will be key for sustained growth.
