In fiscal year 2021, Microsoft generated $76.7 billion from operating activities, reflecting strong core profitability driven by growth across segments. Investing activities used $27.6 billion, primarily for acquisitions, property, and equipment, indicating ongoing capital investment to support future expansion. Financing activities consumed $48.5 billion, mainly due to $23 billion in share repurchases and dividends, offset by debt issuance and repayments. Compared to prior periods, cash flow from operations increased significantly, enhancing liquidity, while capital expenditures and share repurchases suggest a focus on growth and shareholder returns. The company's robust operating cash flow and substantial cash reserves position it well for future investments and debt management, though high capital deployment and ongoing transition taxes highlight potential liquidity and leverage considerations. Overall, Microsoft demonstrates effective cash management with strong liquidity, supporting sustained growth and financial stability.
