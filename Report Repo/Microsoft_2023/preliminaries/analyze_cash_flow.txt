In fiscal year 2023, Microsoft generated $87.6 billion from operating activities, reflecting strong core profitability despite a slight decline from prior year, driven by increased employee and supplier payments. Investing activities used $22.7 billion, primarily for property, equipment, and acquisitions, indicating ongoing capital expansion. Financing activities consumed $43.9 billion, mainly due to share repurchases ($18.4 billion) and dividend payments ($20.2 billion), though debt repayments decreased, supporting liquidity. Cash and equivalents grew to $111.3 billion, underscoring robust liquidity management. The trend shows disciplined cash flow utilization, with ample liquidity to fund growth initiatives and shareholder returns, though high capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions suggest future cash needs. Overall, Microsoft maintains strong cash management, ensuring resilience against potential challenges and capacity for sustained investment and shareholder value creation.
