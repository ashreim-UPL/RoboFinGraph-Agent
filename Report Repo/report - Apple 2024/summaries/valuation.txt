Apple's valuation is supported by steady revenue growth coupled with a strong balance sheet. The company reported revenues of $391 billion, with robust service earnings and stable Mac performance, even as iPhone and iPad segments showed limited movement. Improved cost efficiencies drove an enhanced gross margin and helped deliver a net income of $93.7 billion with healthy EPS. On the balance sheet, substantial cash reserves of over $140 billion help offset an $86 billion long-term debt. Although current liabilities exceed current assets, the overall asset base and resilient shareholders’ equity underpin a sound liquidity profile. This balanced approach, combining diversified revenue streams with disciplined capital management, highlights Apple’s stable financial health and its potential for sustained growth amid evolving market dynamics.
