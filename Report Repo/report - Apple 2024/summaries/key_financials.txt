Appleâ€™s financial numbers in fiscal 2024 reflect balanced strength across income, balance sheet, and cash flow management. Revenue grew modestly, driven by a surge in services and improved cost efficiencies that bolstered gross margins despite mixed performance across product lines. Profitability remained resilient with record net income and strong earnings per share, underlining investor confidence. A robust balance sheet featuring $365 billion in assets supported liquidity needs and managed rising liabilities, while ample cash reserves alleviated long-term debt concerns. Strong operational cash generation allowed continued investments in product innovation, even as significant capital returns through share repurchases and dividends underscored a commitment to rewarding shareholders. Overall, Apple maintained effective financial management and strategic capital allocation to support sustainable growth in a challenging market environment.
