Analyzing Intel's most recent fiscal year (2024), the balance sheet reveals total assets of approximately $196.5 billion, with current assets at $47.3 billion and total liabilities at $91.45 billion, indicating a solid liquidity position given current assets exceed current liabilities ($47.3B vs. $35.7B). Long-term debt stands at $46.3 billion, reflecting manageable leverage relative to total assets (~23.5%), though slightly elevated compared to prior years' debt levels (~$42 billion in 2023). Shareholders' equity is robust at nearly $99.3 billion, supporting long-term investment potential. The asset management appears efficient, with a high proportion of property, plant, and equipment ($107.9B) and intangible assets ($3.7B). Overall, Intel maintains a stable capital structure with prudent leverage, strong asset base, and healthy liquidity, positioning it well for future strategic investments despite some debt increase.
