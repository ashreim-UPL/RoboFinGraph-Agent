**Revenue Trends:** For FY2024, Intel reported total revenue of $54.2 billion, a 14% decline from $63.1 billion in FY2023, primarily driven by a 20% drop in Data Center and AI (DCAI) revenue to $15.5 billion and a 31% decrease in Network and Edge (NEX) to $5.8 billion, reflecting softer demand and inventory adjustments. Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue declined 8% to $27.4 billion, impacted by lower notebook and desktop volumes. **Cost Control & Margins:** Gross margin contracted from 42.6% to 40.0%, decreasing $4.7 billion to $21.7 billion, mainly due to lower revenue and higher costs from product mix shifts, indicating pressure on cost efficiency. **Profitability & EPS:** Net income plummeted 79% to $1.7 billion, with EPS dropping from $1.94 to $0.40, highlighting significant profit erosion amid declining revenues and margin compression. **Overall Health:** The company faces operational challenges with declining top-line growth, margin squeeze, and reduced profitability, signaling a need for strategic cost management and product innovation to restore competitive strength.
