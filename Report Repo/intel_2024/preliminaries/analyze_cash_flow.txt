In fiscal year 2023, the company generated $11.47 billion from operating activities, reflecting solid core profitability despite a decline from $15.43 billion in 2022. Investing outflows were substantial at $24.04 billion, primarily due to increased capital expenditures ($25.8 billion) and lower proceeds from divestitures, indicating aggressive capacity expansion aligned with IDM 2.0. Financing inflows of $8.51 billion, driven by higher debt issuance, partially offset these outflows, while dividend payments decreased to $3.1 billion. Compared to prior periods, cash flow volatility highlights ongoing investments and strategic debt use, with liquidity remaining adequate at $25 billion in total cash and investments. Overall, the company demonstrates strong cash management, leveraging debt and investments to fund growth, but high capital spending and investment risks could pressure liquidity and margins if revenue growth stalls.
