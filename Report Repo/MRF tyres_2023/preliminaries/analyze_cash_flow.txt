In 2023, the company generated strong operating cash flow of \$2,755.47 million, reflecting robust core profitability despite a significant increase in capital expenditures to \$3,291.24 million, indicating aggressive investment. Investing activities resulted in a net outflow of \$1,923.47 million, primarily due to higher capital spending, though some inflows from other investments mitigated this. Financing activities showed a net outflow of \$839.54 million, driven by debt repayment and dividends, with debt issuance reversing previous net inflows. The slight negative net change in cash (\$5.88 million) suggests effective cash management amidst substantial investments and debt reduction. Compared to 2022, cash flows improved markedly from negative operating cash flow, but high capital expenditures pose liquidity and sustainability considerations. Overall, the company demonstrates strong operational performance but faces challenges balancing growth investments with liquidity preservation.
