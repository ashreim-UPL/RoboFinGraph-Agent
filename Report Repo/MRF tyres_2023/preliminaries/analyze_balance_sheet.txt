The company's 2023 balance sheet reveals a solid asset base with total assets of $24,369.41 million, driven by substantial property, plant, equipment ($13,137.89 million) and current assets ($9,243.68 million). Liquidity appears stable, with current assets exceeding current liabilities ($7,495.32 million), though a slight decline in current assets from 2022 suggests tightening liquidity. Long-term debt remains manageable at $1,332.20 million, representing a low leverage ratio, while total debt decreased slightly from 2022. Shareholders' equity increased to $14,707.66 million, reflecting retained earnings growth and a strong capital position. The firm demonstrates prudent asset management and moderate leverage, supporting long-term stability. The upward trend in retained earnings and consistent asset growth indicate positive operational performance, though attention to liquidity management is advisable amid slight asset contraction.
