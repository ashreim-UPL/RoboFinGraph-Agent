In fiscal year 2024, Microsoft generated $118.5 billion from operating activities, reflecting strong core profitability driven by growth across segments. Investing activities used $97.0 billion, primarily due to a significant $67.5 billion spent on acquisitions and increased capital expenditures, indicating aggressive expansion and investment in AI and cloud infrastructure. Financing activities consumed $37.8 billion, with $12.0 billion spent on share repurchases and $22.3 billion in dividends, offset by $3.3 billion in debt proceeds. Compared to prior periods, cash flows from operations remain robust, supporting ongoing investments and shareholder returns. The company's liquidity position remains healthy with substantial cash reserves, demonstrating effective cash management. However, high capital deployment and acquisition costs suggest a focus on growth, which could pose liquidity risks if revenue growth slows or investments do not yield expected returns.
