In FY 2023, the company generated ₹2,630.27 crore from operating activities, reflecting strong core profitability, supported by increased net income and efficient working capital management. Investing cash flows were negative at ₹2,313.10 crore, primarily due to substantial capital expenditures (~₹2,211.95 crore), indicating ongoing expansion and asset enhancement. Financing activities showed a modest outflow of ₹205.14 crore, driven by debt repayment (~₹153.27 crore) and minimal equity issuance, with positive cash inflow from stock issuance (₹14.63 crore). Compared to the previous year, operating cash flow more than doubled, while investing outflows increased, suggesting aggressive growth investments. The company's robust operating cash flow and manageable financing outflows point to effective cash management, supporting liquidity and future growth, though high capital expenditure warrants monitoring for sustainability and potential liquidity risks.
