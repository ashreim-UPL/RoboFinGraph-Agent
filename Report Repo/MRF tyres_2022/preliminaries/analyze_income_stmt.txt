Revenue Growth and Sources:
The company's revenue increased by 19.4% YoY to Rs. 19,316.72 crore in FY2022, driven primarily by higher sales volumes and export growth, with exports rising 33% to Rs. 1,779 crore. Domestic sales also contributed to this positive trend, reflecting recovery post-pandemic.

Cost of Goods Sold:
The Cost of Revenue rose by 35.5% to Rs. 13,900.31 crore, outpacing revenue growth, indicating rising raw material and input costs. This pressure impacted margins, highlighting challenges in cost control amid inflationary pressures.

Profit Margins:
Gross profit declined slightly to Rs. 5,416.41 crore (from Rs. 5,919.52 crore), with gross margin decreasing from 36.6% to 28%. Operating profit halved to Rs. 908.96 crore, with net profit dropping by 47.6% to Rs. 669.24 crore, reflecting squeezed margins and increased expenses.

EPS and Investor Outlook:
Diluted EPS excluding extra items fell sharply from Rs. 3,011.15 to Rs. 1,577.97, signaling reduced profitability per share. Despite revenue growth, margin compression and higher costs have impacted overall financial health, emphasizing the need for cost management and operational efficiencies to sustain investor confidence.
