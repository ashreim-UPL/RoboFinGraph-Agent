The company's net cash flow in FY 2022 was a modest inflow of Rs. 11.84 crore, a significant improvement from a net outflow of Rs. 1011.67 crore in FY 2021. Operating cash flow turned negative at Rs. -578.03 crore, primarily due to a substantial change in working capital, indicating challenges in core operations despite a healthy net income. Investing activities showed a positive Rs. 165.01 crore, driven by reduced capital expenditures and favorable asset disposals, contrasting sharply with FY 2021â€™s large outflows. Financing activities contributed Rs. 423.76 crore, mainly from debt issuance, reflecting strategic leverage to support liquidity amid profit pressures. Overall, while liquidity remains manageable, the negative operating cash flow signals pressure on operational efficiency, necessitating careful cash management to sustain future growth and mitigate liquidity risks.
