**Segment Analysis**

**Automotive & Auto Components:**  
The company’s automotive segment, including passenger vehicles, two-wheelers, and commercial vehicles, faced supply chain disruptions, raw material cost hikes, and geopolitical uncertainties (Management Discussion, p. 38). Despite a 19% growth in passenger vehicle production and a 33% surge in two-wheeler exports, profit margins declined sharply due to raw material inflation, with net profit decreasing from Rs. 1249 crore in 2021 to Rs. 647 crore in 2022 (Income Statement). The sector’s strategic focus on EVs and PLI schemes aims to offset challenges, but high input costs and interest rate hikes remain significant hurdles. Market share remains strong, but profit margins are under pressure from rising costs and supply constraints, impacting overall profitability.

**Tyre & Rubber Products:**  
The tyre segment achieved 18% revenue growth to Rs. 19,304 crore, driven by a 15% increase in Heavy Commercial Vehicle tyres and a 33% rise in exports, notably in Africa, Middle East, and Asia (Income Statement, p. 38). Product innovations, including new aftermarket offerings and EV-compatible tyres, contributed to income growth, while export volumes surged 33%. However, input costs increased significantly, compressing margins and reducing net profit from Rs. 1249 crore to Rs. 647 crore. The segment’s market position as a top tyre manufacturer is maintained, but profit challenges stem from raw material inflation and logistical costs, requiring strategic cost management.

**Strategic Partnerships & Market Dynamics:**  
The company’s trade agreements with UAE and Australia (Management Discussion, p. 38) are expected to enhance export opportunities and market share. Collaborations with government initiatives like the PLI scheme bolster manufacturing and supply chain resilience. Market dynamics, including rising energy prices, inflation, and geopolitical tensions, have increased operational costs and constrained profit margins. The company’s focus on expanding into newer markets and product segments, especially EVs, aims to sustain growth amid these challenges, but high input costs and supply chain bottlenecks continue to pressure profitability.

**Summary:**  
Overall, the company’s segments show revenue growth driven by exports and product innovation, but profit margins declined due to raw material inflation and supply chain issues. Strategic trade partnerships and EV-focused product development position the company for future growth, despite current cost pressures and geopolitical uncertainties impacting profitability and market share stability.
