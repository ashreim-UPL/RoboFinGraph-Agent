The key financials of MRF Tyres for FY2022 show a revenue increase of 19.4% to Rs. 19,316.72 crore, driven by higher domestic and export sales, with exports rising 33%. However, the cost of goods sold grew faster at 35.5%, reaching Rs. 13,900.31 crore, which compressed profit margins. Gross profit declined slightly to Rs. 5,416.41 crore, with gross margin decreasing from 36.6% to 28%. Operating profit halved to Rs. 908.96 crore, and net profit fell by 47.6% to Rs. 669.24 crore, reflecting margin pressures and rising expenses. Earnings per share dropped significantly from Rs. 3,011.15 to Rs. 1,577.97. The company's balance sheet remains strong with total assets of Rs. 23,059.74 crore and shareholders' equity of Rs. 14,031.75 crore. Despite healthy asset management, negative operating cash flow indicates operational challenges that need addressing for sustained growth.
