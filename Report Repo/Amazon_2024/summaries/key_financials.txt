Amazon displays a solid financial performance across its income statement, balance sheet and cash flow in 2024, reflecting a healthy growth trajectory and sound financial management. Revenue increased driven by robust AWS performance and strong North American contributions, supporting enhanced operating and net income figures along with improved margins and higher earnings per share. Growth in both current and non-current assets, combined with significant equity expansion and a modest decrease in long-term debt, underscores enhanced financial stability. Operating cash flow rose substantially, providing ample support for strategic capital deployments in technology and fulfillment infrastructure while maintaining strong liquidity. Overall, Amazonâ€™s strategic cost management, disciplined asset control and growing cash generation position the company well for sustained operational success and future expansion.
