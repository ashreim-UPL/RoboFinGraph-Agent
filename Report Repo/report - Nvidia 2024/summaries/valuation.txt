NVIDIAâ€™s valuation is driven by extraordinary growth and strong profitability. Fiscal 2025 revenue reached $130.5 billion, led by a significant surge in Data Center revenue and underpinned by excellent gross margins of 75%. Operating income and net income soared by nearly 147% and 145%, reflecting efficient cost control and remarkable operational performance. The balance sheet confirms a solid financial base with total assets of $111.6 billion, largely supported by $80.1 billion in current assets including $43.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. Low current liabilities and manageable long-term debt of $8.5 billion bolster liquidity, while a marked increase in equity to $79.3 billion underscores a healthy capital structure. This robust profile positions NVIDIA favorably for future strategic investments despite potential market challenges.
