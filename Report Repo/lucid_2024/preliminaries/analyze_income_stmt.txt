**Revenue Growth & Sources:**  
Lucid reported $807.8 million in FY 2024, a 36% increase from $595.3 million in 2023, driven primarily by 4,240 more vehicle deliveries and $29.1 million in regulatory credit sales, despite a lower average vehicle price.  

**Cost & Margins:**  
Cost of revenue declined 11% to $1.73 billion, improving gross loss by $417.7 million to -$923.1 million, reflecting inventory write-down reductions and cost efficiencies. However, gross margin remains negative, indicating ongoing production and scale challenges.  

**Profitability & EPS:**  
Net loss widened slightly to -$2.71 billion, with EPS at -$1.25, signaling persistent operational losses. Despite revenue growth, negative margins highlight the need for cost control and scale-up to reach profitability.  

**Strategic Outlook:**  
While revenue momentum is promising, high operating expenses and continued net losses suggest that achieving sustainable profitability depends on scaling production, reducing costs, and expanding high-margin revenue streams.
