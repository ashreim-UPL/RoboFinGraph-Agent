The company's most recent balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, shows total assets of approximately $9.65 billion, with current assets at $4.87 billion and non-current assets at $4.77 billion, indicating a solid asset base. Current liabilities stand at $1.17 billion, primarily short-term debt and payables, with a current ratio near 4.2, reflecting strong liquidity. Long-term debt is $3.31 billion, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of roughly 0.86, suggesting moderate leverage. Shareholders' equity of $3.87 billion has increased from prior years, driven by capital raises and retained earnings, though the negative retained earnings highlight ongoing losses. Overall, the firm maintains a healthy asset management profile and manageable leverage, but its substantial accumulated deficit underscores the need for sustained operational improvements to enhance long-term financial stability and growth potential.
