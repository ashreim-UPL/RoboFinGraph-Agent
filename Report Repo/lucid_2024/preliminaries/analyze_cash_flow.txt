In 2024, Lucid experienced a net cash outflow of approximately $2.02 billion from operating activities, reflecting ongoing investments in growth despite significant losses, with a slight improvement from 2023â€™s $2.49 billion outflow. Investing activities consumed about $1.29 billion, primarily due to increased purchases of investments and capital expenditures supporting manufacturing expansion, notably in Saudi Arabia. Conversely, financing activities generated roughly $3.55 billion, driven by substantial proceeds from equity offerings, preferred stock issuances, and debt facilities, indicating strong capital raising efforts. The reduction in operating cash burn compared to prior year suggests improving cash management, but the persistent negative cash flows highlight reliance on external financing and liquidity risks. Overall, while liquidity remains robust with over $5 billion in cash and credit lines, sustained operational losses and high capital needs pose challenges to long-term financial stability and growth prospects.
