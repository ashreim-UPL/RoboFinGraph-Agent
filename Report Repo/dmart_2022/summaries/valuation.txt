DMart’s valuation is underpinned by its strong revenue growth, stable margins, and robust profitability, as evidenced by a 28.3 percent YoY revenue increase and a 35.7 percent rise in net profit for FY22. The company’s disciplined cost control and efficient operations have resulted in improved profitability ratios and a healthy return on net worth. With a minimal debt-equity ratio of 0.03 and shareholders’ equity of INR 13,677.64 crore, DMart’s balance sheet reflects financial strength and low leverage risk. Substantial investments in property and equipment support future expansion, while a current ratio of 3.06 indicates sound liquidity. Despite minor pressure on liquidity, DMart’s consistent earnings growth, prudent asset management, and strong capital structure justify a premium valuation relative to peers in the retail sector.
