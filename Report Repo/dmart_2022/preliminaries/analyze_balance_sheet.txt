The company's balance sheet for FY 2022 reveals a robust asset base of ₹15,472.64 crore, with current assets constituting approximately 22% (₹3,442.85 crore) of total assets, indicating moderate liquidity, supported by a healthy current ratio of 3.06. Long-term assets, notably Property/Plant/Equipment net at ₹10,288.45 crore, demonstrate substantial investment in operational infrastructure. Total liabilities increased to ₹1,795 crore, with long-term debt at ₹507.15 crore, reflecting manageable leverage (Debt-Equity ratio of 0.03). Shareholders’ equity stands strong at ₹13,677.64 crore, showing consistent growth from previous years, driven by retained earnings. The decline in current assets and receivables turnover suggests slight pressure on liquidity, but overall, the firm maintains a stable capital structure with prudent asset management, positioning it well for sustained operational efficiency and future expansion.
