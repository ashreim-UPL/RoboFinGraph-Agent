The company's net cash flow from operating activities remained stable at approximately ₹1372-1375 crore in FY22 and FY21, indicating consistent core business profitability. Capital expenditures increased significantly to ₹2410 crore in FY22 from ₹2029 crore, reflecting ongoing investments in expansion, while cash used in investing activities rose to ₹1289 crore from ₹1110 crore, suggesting heightened capital deployment. Financing cash flows were relatively stable, with slight variations, and net cash decreased by ₹96.38 crore in FY22, contrasting with an inflow of ₹85.64 crore in FY21, highlighting liquidity consumption primarily driven by higher capital spending and tax payments. Overall, the company demonstrates effective cash management with a strong operational cash flow, but increased capital investments and tax outflows pose potential liquidity challenges, requiring vigilant liquidity monitoring to sustain future growth.
