In fiscal 2024, Visa generated $19.95 billion from operating activities, reflecting strong core business cash flow despite slight declines from prior year, driven by higher incentive payments and tax outflows. Investing cash outflows of $1.93 billion were modest, mainly due to acquisitions and capital expenditures, indicating ongoing strategic investments. Financing activities saw a significant outflow of $20.63 billion, primarily from $17 billion in share repurchases and $4.2 billion in dividends, with no debt repayments, highlighting aggressive capital return policies. Compared to previous years, cash flows remain robust, supporting liquidity and strategic growth, though high share repurchases and dividends could pressure liquidity if revenue growth slows. Overall, Visa demonstrates effective cash management, maintaining ample liquidity ($17.4 billion total cash and investments), but continued large-scale buybacks and dividends warrant monitoring for future financial flexibility amid potential market or litigation uncertainties.
