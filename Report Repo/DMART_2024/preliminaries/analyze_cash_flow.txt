In FY 2024, the company generated `2,745.84 crore from operating activities, reflecting healthy core profitability despite a slight increase in working capital outflows. Capital expenditures rose to `2,731.25 crore, indicating ongoing investments in expansion and infrastructure, while cash used in investing activities was `2,468.23 crore, slightly higher than the previous year, suggesting sustained capital deployment. Financing cash flows remained negative at `147.64 crore, primarily due to debt repayment and stock issuance, with a modest net cash inflow of `129.97 crore. Compared to FY 2023, operational cash flow improved marginally, but high capital expenditure and consistent debt reduction highlight a focus on growth and liquidity preservation. Overall, the company's cash management appears disciplined, supporting liquidity and future growth prospects, though substantial capital outflows pose short-term liquidity considerations.
