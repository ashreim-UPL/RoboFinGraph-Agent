**Revenue Growth:**  
The company’s revenue increased by 18.56% YoY to ₹50,789 crore in FY 2024, driven primarily by organic store expansion (from 324 to 365 stores) and higher sales per retail area (₹32,941 vs. ₹31,096). This consistent growth indicates strong market demand and effective expansion strategies.

**Cost of Revenue & Margins:**  
Cost of revenue rose by 19.07% to ₹43,651 crore, slightly outpacing revenue growth, leading to a decline in gross profit margin from 14.4% to 14.1%. Despite higher costs, the company maintained a healthy gross profit of ₹7,137 crore, though margin compression suggests pressure on cost control.

**Profitability & Margins:**  
Operating profit increased modestly by 12.3% to ₹3,379.86 crore, with operating margin declining from 7.84% to 7.38%. Net profit grew by 6.61% to ₹2,536 crore, with net margin decreasing from 6.11% to 5.44%, reflecting margin compression amid rising expenses.

**Earnings & Investor Metrics:**  
Diluted EPS rose by 6.69% to ₹38.93, with a slight reduction in diluted shares (from 65.18 to 65.15 crore), indicating steady earnings growth and investor confidence despite margin pressures.

**Strategic Outlook:**  
While revenue growth remains robust, rising costs and margin compression highlight the need for enhanced cost efficiencies. Continued store expansion and operational improvements are vital for sustaining profitability and shareholder value.
