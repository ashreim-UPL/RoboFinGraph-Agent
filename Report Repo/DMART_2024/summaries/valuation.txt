The valuation of DMart reflects its strong revenue growth driven by store expansion and higher sales per retail area, supported by a solid asset base of over 21,000 crore and high liquidity indicated by a current ratio of 3.23. Despite rising costs leading to margin compression, the company maintains healthy profitability with a net profit of 2,536 crore and steady earnings growth, evidenced by a 6.69% increase in EPS. Its low leverage, with a debt-equity ratio of 0.02 and stable long-term debt, underscores financial stability. The significant increase in shareholders’ equity to nearly 18,700 crore highlights strong retained earnings and capital reserves. Overall, DMart’s robust asset position, consistent revenue growth, and prudent financial management suggest a resilient valuation outlook, though margin pressures warrant attention for sustained profitability.
