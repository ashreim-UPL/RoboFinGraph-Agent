**Visa’s Business Segments and Analysis**

Visa operates primarily through a single, integrated payments technology segment, with revenue driven by payments volume, processed transactions, and cross-border activity. In FY2024, revenue reached $35.9 billion, up 31% from $26.7 billion in FY2023, reflecting growth in payments volume and cross-border transactions, aided by fewer COVID-19 restrictions. Net income was $19.74 billion, a 14% increase from $17.27 billion, supported by higher transaction volumes and improved operating efficiencies. Strategic partnerships, such as acquisitions of Tink AB (€1.8 billion) and Currencycloud (£700 million), expand product offerings and cross-border capabilities, positively impacting revenue streams. Product innovations, including enhanced transaction processing and digital solutions, contributed to a 17% rise in service and data processing revenues, underpinning income growth. Visa maintains a dominant market position with a 17% increase in processed transactions (164.7 million in FY2024), reinforcing its leadership amid evolving market dynamics. However, profit challenges include rising operating expenses (up 8% to $8.3 billion) and client incentives, which grew 26%, partly offsetting revenue gains. Market growth is driven by increased global payments volume, but regulatory changes and national policies, such as indirect tax adjustments and litigation provisions, pose potential profit headwinds. Overall, Visa’s strategic investments in technology and partnerships, combined with a resilient market position, support sustained income growth despite rising operational costs.
