In fiscal 2021, Visa generated $15.2 billion from operating activities, reflecting strong core business profitability driven by increased payments volume and transaction growth. Investing cash flows were negative at $152 million, primarily due to higher purchases of investment securities, indicating ongoing capital deployment but manageable liquidity risk. Financing activities used $14.4 billion, mainly from substantial share repurchases ($8.7 billion) and debt repayments ($3 billion), with dividends totaling $2.8 billion, demonstrating active capital return policies. Compared to prior periods, operating cash flow improved significantly, supporting liquidity and investment capacity, while increased share repurchases suggest confidence in future prospects. Overall, Visa's cash management appears effective, maintaining a robust liquidity position with ample cash and investments, positioning the company well for growth and resilience amid potential challenges.
