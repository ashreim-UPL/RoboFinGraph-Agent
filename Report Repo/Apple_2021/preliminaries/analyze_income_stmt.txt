**Revenue Growth & Sources:**  
Apple’s FY2024 revenue reached $391 billion, a slight increase of 1.8% YoY from $383 billion in FY2023, driven primarily by sustained growth in Services (+27%) to $68.4 billion and Wearables, Home, and Accessories (+25%) to $38.4 billion. The iPhone segment remains the largest contributor, accounting for $192 billion, though its growth slowed to 39% YoY from 2020.  

**Cost Control & Margins:**  
Cost of revenue stood at $210.4 billion, resulting in a gross profit of $180.7 billion and a gross margin of 46.2%, up from 44.1% in FY2023, indicating improved cost leverage and product mix. Operating expenses increased modestly to $57.5 billion, with operating margin at 31.4%. Net income of $93.7 billion yields a net profit margin of 24%, reflecting strong operational efficiency.  

**Profitability & EPS:**  
Earnings per share (EPS) of $6.11 (diluted $6.08) demonstrate solid investor returns, with net income growth supporting shareholder value. The consistent margin expansion and high profitability margins highlight effective cost management and revenue diversification.  

**Strategic Outlook:**  
Apple’s revenue stability, margin improvements, and robust EPS underscore a resilient financial position amid global economic uncertainties. Continued growth in services and wearables, coupled with disciplined cost control, positions Apple favorably against industry peers, though reliance on iPhone sales remains a key factor to monitor.
