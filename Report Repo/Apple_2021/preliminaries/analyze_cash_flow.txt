In FY 2024, Apple generated robust operating cash flow of $118.25 billion, reflecting strong core business profitability, despite a slight net cash decrease of $794 million. Investing activities contributed a modest inflow of $2.94 billion, primarily from sales of investments, offsetting capital expenditures of $9.45 billion. Financing activities, however, resulted in a significant outflow of nearly $122 billion, mainly due to net stock repurchases of $94.95 billion and dividends paid of $15.23 billion, indicating aggressive capital return strategies. Compared to prior years, cash flows remain healthy, but the substantial financing outflows highlight ongoing liquidity deployment risks. Overall, Appleâ€™s cash management appears effective, maintaining substantial liquidity ($29.94 billion at period end), supporting future growth, though high capital return commitments could pose challenges if operating conditions shift.
