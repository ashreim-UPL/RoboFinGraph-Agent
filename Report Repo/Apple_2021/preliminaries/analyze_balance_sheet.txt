Appleâ€™s FY2024 balance sheet reveals a robust asset base of $365 billion, with significant current assets ($153 billion) surpassing current liabilities ($176 billion), indicating strong liquidity but a high current ratio (~0.87). Non-current assets ($212 billion) and long-term investments ($91 billion) bolster long-term stability. Total liabilities ($308 billion) are substantial, with long-term debt ($86 billion) constituting a key component, yet the company maintains a healthy equity position of $57 billion, reflecting a conservative leverage ratio (~2.7x debt to equity). Compared to FY2023 and FY2022, assets and liabilities have grown, but liquidity remains stable, and equity has increased, signaling steady operational efficiency and asset management. Overall, Apple exhibits prudent capital structure management, leveraging assets effectively while maintaining sufficient liquidity and a solid equity cushion, supporting its long-term growth and investment potential.
