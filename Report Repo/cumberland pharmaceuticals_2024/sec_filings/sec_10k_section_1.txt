 Item 1. Business. 

THE COMPANY 

Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. ("Cumberland," the "Company," or as used in the context of "we," "us," or "our"), is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of branded prescription pharmaceuticals. We are dedicated to our mission of working together to provide unique products that improve the quality of patient care. 

Our primary target markets are hospital acute care, gastroenterology and oncology. These medical specialties are characterized by relatively concentrated prescriber bases that we believe can be served effectively by small, targeted sales forces. We promote our approved products through our hospital, field and oncology sales divisions in the United States. We continue to build a network of established international partners with the needed regulatory and commercial capabilities to register and provide our medicines to patients in their countries. 

Our portfolio of brands approved for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) includes: 

&#8226; Acetadote &#174; ( acetylcysteine ) injection, for the treatment of acetaminophen poisoning; 

&#8226; Caldolor &#174; ( ibuprofen ) injection, for the treatment of pain and fever; 

&#8226; Kristalose &#174; ( lactulose ) for oral solution, a prescription laxative, for the treatment of constipation; 

&#8226; Sancuso &#174; ( granisetron) transdermal, for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving certain types of chemotherapy treatment; 

&#8226; Vaprisol &#174; ( conivaptan ) injection, to raise serum sodium levels in hospitalized patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia; and 

&#8226; Vibativ &#174; ( telavancin ) injection, for the treatment of certain serious bacterial infections including hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, as well as complicated skin and skin structure infections. 

In addition to these commercial brands, we have Phase II clinical programs underway evaluating our ifetroban product candidate in patients with 1) Systemic Sclerosis (&#8220;SSc&#8221;) or scleroderma, a debilitating autoimmune disorder characterized by diffuse fibrosis of the skin and internal organs and 2) Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (&#8220;IPF&#8221;), the most common form of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease. Investigational new study applications have been cleared by the FDA enabling us to launch clinical studies in each of these areas. 

Additionally, we recently completed a Phase II study in patients with cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (&#8220;DMD&#8221;), a rare, fatal, genetic neuromuscular disease results in deterioration of the skeletal, heart and lung muscles. Next steps for this DMD Program include further data analysis and completion of a full study report in preparation for an end-of-Phase-II meeting with the FDA to determine next steps associated with the product&#8217;s development and commercialization. 

Cumberland has built core competencies for the acquisition, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. and we believe we can leverage this existing infrastructure to support our continued growth. Our management team consists of pharmaceutical industry veterans with experience in business development, product development, regulatory, manufacturing, sales, marketing and finance. 

Our business development team identifies, evaluates, and negotiates product acquisition, licensing and co-promotion agreements. Our product development team creates proprietary formulations, manages our clinical studies, prepares our FDA submissions and staffs our medical call center. Our quality and manufacturing professionals oversee the manufacturing, release and shipment of our brands. Our marketing and sales organization is responsible for our commercial activities, and we work closely with our distribution partners to ensure the availability and delivery of our products. 

Sustainability Metrics 

We issued our inaugural Sustainability Report in 2019, detailing Cumberland&#8217;s activities pertaining to our environmental, social and governance matters, and we remain committed to sustainability and to maintaining transparency of our corporate operations. As one of the largest biopharmaceutical companies founded and headquartered in the Mid-South, we hold ourselves to the highest standards of ethical practices and understand the importance of recognizing and addressing our impact on our constituents, our community and the environment. 

Our 2024 sustainability metrics noted that during that year we provided 3.9 million patient doses of our brands, while safely disposing of nearly 12,480 pounds of expired and damaged goods. We had no product recalls and no clinical trials terminated due to failure to practice good clinical standards. 

In 2024, we also highlighted our investment in our employees through our continuing education programs, employee development initiatives and employee recognition awards. We reported that women represented 49% of Cumberland&#8217;s workforce and 27% of our employees were minorities. 

Through our sustainability initiatives, we will continue to identify and address critical industry issues, monitor relevant guidelines and utilize best practices.

Acetadote &#174; 

Acetadote is an intravenous formulation of N-acetylcysteine, indicated for the treatment of liver toxicity associated with acetaminophen poisoning. Cumberland developed and obtained U.S. FDA approval for Acetadote, and then introduced the product through our hospital sales force. 

Acetadote is typically used in hospital emergency departments to prevent or lessen potential liver damage resulting from an overdose of acetaminophen, a common ingredient in many over-the-counter and prescription pain-relieving and fever-reducing products. Acetaminophen overdose continues to be a leading cause of poisonings reported by hospital emergency departments in the U.S., and Acetadote became a standard of care for treating this potentially life-threatening condition. 

Acetadote received U.S. FDA approval as an orphan drug, which provided seven years of marketing exclusivity from the date of approval. That exclusivity has since expired. In connection with the FDA&#8217;s approval of Acetadote, we committed to certain post-marketing activities for the product. Completion of our first Phase IV commitment resulted in the FDA&#8217;s approval of expanded labeling for the product for use in pediatric patients. Completion of our second Phase IV commitment resulted in further revised labeling for the product with FDA approval of additional safety data. 

Completion of our third and final Phase IV commitment culminated in the FDA&#8217;s approval of a new formulation for the product. The next generation formulation contains no ethylene diamine tetracetic acid (&#8220;EDTA&#8221;) or other stabilization agent, chelating agent or preservative. Cumberland introduced this new Acetadote formulation replacing the original form of the product which we no longer manufacture. 

The FDA subsequently approved updated labeling for Acetadote revising the product&#8217;s indication and providing new dosing guidance for specific patient populations. As a result, dosing guidance was included for patients weighing over 100 kg, and new language was added to alert health care providers that, in certain clinical situations, therapy should be extended for some patients. 

In 2024, the FDA approved a supplemental New Drug Application for Acetadote, adding a simplified dosing regimen for the product prescribing information. This newly approved dosing regimen simplifies the administration of Acetadote by combining the first two bags of the standard regimen into a single, slower infusion. This streamlined approach has been implemented in hospitals across multiple countries and demonstrated to reduce the frequency of medication errors and potentially serious non-allergic anaphylactoid reactions without compromising the effectiveness of Acetadote. 

The United States Patent and Trademark Office (the &#8220;USPTO&#8221;) issued us a series of patents associated with our Acetadote product. These patents are discussed in Part I, Item I &#8211; &#8220; Business - Trademarks and Patents &#8221; &#8211; of this Form 10-K. The FDA has approved several abbreviated new drug applications (&#8220;ANDA&#8221;) filed by various generics companies referencing Acetadote. Those products all possess the old formulation containing EDTA. 

We entered into an agreement with Perrigo Company resulting in the distribution of our Authorized Generic acetylcysteine injection (our &#8220;Authorized Generic&#8221;) product. Both Acetadote and our Authorized Generic utilize the new, EDTA-free formulation. 

An Illinois judge issued a final ruling in favor of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. in a patent case associated with Acetadote. By ruling in Cumberland&#8217;s favor, the court upheld the validity of the patent that encompasses our EDTA-free formulation. The court also granted a permanent injunction preventing challengers from marketing a generic version of our proprietary Acetadote product formulation before the expiration of one of Cumberland&#8217;s patents in August 2025. An Appeals Court affirmed the District Court ruling in the Company&#8217;s favor upholding Cumberland&#8217;s Acetadote patent and expressly rejected the validity challenge. 

During 2024, we continued to distribute our Acetadote brand, however our Authorized Generic product is now distributed through Padagis US LLC (formerly a division of Perrigo Company). 

Caldolor &#174; 

Caldolor, our intravenous formulation of ibuprofen, was the first injectable product approved in the U.S. for the treatment of both pain and fever. We conducted a series of clinical studies in over 900 adult patients to develop the data to support our FDA submission for the product&#8217;s registration. Following a priority review, the FDA approved Caldolor for marketing in the U.S. 

A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (&#8220;NSAID&#8221;), the product was indicated for use in adults as a sole treatment for the management of mild to moderate pain and for the management of moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics. It was also the first FDA-approved intravenous therapy for treating fever. 

We then launched Caldolor and continue to promote the product in the U.S. through our hospital sales force. 

We completed a series of Phase IV studies to gather additional data to support our Caldolor product. Those clinical trials involved another 1,000 adult and pediatric patients. These studies included data on a shortened infusion time and pre-surgical administration of the product. To address our Phase IV commitment to the FDA, these studies also included evaluation of the product for the reduction of fever in hospitalized children and the treatment of pain in children undergoing tonsillectomy surgeries. 

We then received FDA approval for the use of Caldolor in pediatric patients 6 months of age and older. 

In early 2018, we completed and filed the application for FDA approval of a next generation Caldolor product featuring an improved presentation and formulation which was approved in January 2019. The new, premixed presentation provides health care professionals with a formulation that is easy to administer, helping manage the treatment of patient pain and fever, while reducing opioid consumption. It is provided in a pre-mixed bag containing 800 mg of ibuprofen in a 200 mL patented low sodium formulation for injection that is ready to use. It is the first and only FDA-approved pre-mixed bag of ibuprofen. Caldolor is still available as an 800 mg/8mL single&#8211;dose vial for dilution in addition to the ready-to-use bag. 

In November 2021, the FDA approved our submission to expand the labeling for Caldolor to include administration of the product prior to surgery. During our clinical studies we found that the product delivered its best results when dosed prior to surgery, reducing both patients&#8217; pain as well as their need for opiates. 

We also announced an agreement with PiSA Pharmaceutical for the registration and commercialization of Caldolor in Mexico. Under the terms of the agreement, Cumberland will be responsible for providing the product dossier and supplies. PiSA will be responsible for obtaining regulatory approval for the product in Mexico and introducing it to the new market. PiSA expects to provide the product in both 400- and 800-milligram vials. 

In 2023, the FDA approved expanded labeling for Caldolor to include use in infants 3 to 6 months old. The safety and efficacy of Caldolor has now been established for the treatment of pain and fever in pediatric patients aged 3 months and older. With this newly approved labeling, Caldolor is the only non-opioid product approved to treat pain in infants that is delivered through injection. 

Also in 2023, we announced the publication of positive results from a clinical study investigating the safety and pharmacokinetics of Caldolor in infants. Published in the journal Pediatric Drugs , the results support the FDA&#8217;s approval of Caldolor in patients 3 to 6 months of age. 

In 2024, we announced the release of a Special Report evaluating the growing amount of current data supporting the use of Caldolor as a standard of care for the treatment of pain and fever in adults, children and infants. The results demonstrated that the product is a safe and effective treatment for pain and fever in adults, children and infants as young as 3 months of age. 

Additionally in 2024, we announced the publication of new real-world outcomes research comparing Caldolor to its key competitor &#8211; ketorolac &#8211; in 150,000 patients. Published in Frontiers of Pain Research , the results provided compelling evidence that Caldolor is associated with a significantly reduced incidence of adverse drug reactions and also improved healthcare utilization. 

During 2024, we distributed both the vial and the ready-to-use premixed bag presentations of Caldolor. 

Kristalose &#174; 

Kristalose is a prescription laxative administered orally for the treatment of acute and chronic constipation. An innovative, dry powder crystalline formulation of lactulose, Kristalose is designed to enhance patient acceptance and compliance. It is the only prescription laxative available in pre-measured powder packets. 

Kristalose dissolves easily in 4 ounces of water, offering patients a virtually taste-free, grit-free and essentially calorie-free alternative to lactulose syrups. We conducted a preference study which indicated that 77% of patients surveyed prefer the taste, consistency and portability of Kristalose over similar products in syrup forms. 

We acquired the assets and exclusive rights to Kristalose through a series of transactions, then assembled a dedicated field sales force which re-launched the product as a Cumberland brand. We directed our sales efforts to physicians who are the most prolific writers of prescription laxatives, including gastroenterologists and internists. We supplemented this personal promotion with telemarketing campaigns to expand our reach and support of the product. Using preference data as a cornerstone of our marketing efforts, we repositioned the brand, enhancing patient affordability through a coupon program and expanded managed care coverage for the product. 

We added a co-promotion partner, Poly Pharmaceuticals, who is promoting Kristalose to physician targets not covered by our field sales forces. We then added another partner, Foxland Pharmaceuticals, Inc., who is repackaging Kristalose and featuring it with additional new physician targets. 

The Kristalose award-winning marketing campaign was refreshed for 2022 to support increased engagement with our customers. We also expanded patient support for the brand &#8211; and it was added to the GoodRx platform in 2022. 

During 2023, we continued to support Kristalose through our field sales force as well as our partnerships with Poly Pharmaceuticals and Foxland Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

We have found that the brand performs best in states where we have Medicaid coverage, such as Texas, New York and Wisconsin. We also learned that Kristalose is now covered on certain Virginia, Louisiana and Maine Medicaid plans. We are implementing a special initiative to increase our presence and share of voice in these states and believe that this new coverage is contributing to the growth of the product. 

Sancuso &#174; 

At the end of 2021, we entered into an agreement with Kyowa Kirin to acquire the U.S. assets and rights to Sancuso (granisetron transdermal system), an FDA-approved oncology supportive care medicine. This transaction closed in January 2022. 

Sancuso is the first and only FDA-approved prescription patch for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving certain types of chemotherapy treatment for their cancer. The active drug in Sancuso, granisetron, slowly dissolves in the thin layer of adhesive that sticks to the patient&#8217;s skin and is released into their bloodstream over several days, working continuously to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (&#8220;CINV&#8221;). It is applied 24 to 48 hours before receiving chemotherapy and can prevent CINV for up to five consecutive days. Alternative oral treatments must be taken several times (day and night) to deliver the same therapeutic doses. 

In early 2022, we assumed full commercial responsibility for the product in the U.S. &#8211; including its marketing, promotion, distribution, manufacturing and medical support activities. Kyowa Kirin retained international rights, continuing to deliver the product to address oncology patients&#8217; needs throughout the rest of the world. In January 2022, we began shipments of the product and formed a new sales force, Cumberland Oncology, to support the brand. During 2023, we completed the transition of Sancuso from Kyowa Kirin to Cumberland, including the NDA transfer, and expanded our oncology sales division to further support the brand. We also successfully transferred manufacture of the product to a new facility. Following FDA approval of that site, we introduced our newly Cumberland-packaged product in 2024, supported by our expanded oncology sales division. 

Vaprisol &#174; 

We acquired the assets and rights to Vaprisol, a prescription brand indicated to raise serum sodium levels in hospitalized patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. It is one of two branded prescription products indicated for the treatment of hyponatremia, and the only intravenously administered branded treatment. 

Hyponatremia, an imbalance of serum sodium to body water, is the most common electrolyte disorder among hospitalized patients. These electrolyte disturbances occur when the sodium ion concentration in the plasma is lower than normal and are often associated with a variety of critical care conditions including congestive heart failure, liver failure, kidney failure and pneumonia. Vaprisol raises serum sodium to appropriate levels and promotes free water secretion. Our Vaprisol product has a proven day-one response rate to normalize serum sodium levels in hyponatremic patients and move them out of the Intensive Care Unit as efficiently as possible. 

Vaprisol is supported by our hospital sales division. Demand for the product increased in 2020 during the pandemic, and we worked to support the expanded use of the product in hospitals and clinics during the health care crisis. During 2021, we shipped all remaining inventory of the product and notified the FDA that supplies of the product are not currently available. We have since transferred the product&#8217;s manufacturing to a new facility. Our new manufacturing partner is working with the FDA to address several Form 483 and warning letter issues in a timely manner. We next expect to file for the approval to manufacture branded Vaprisol once all FDA issues at the new site are resolved. 

Vibativ &#174; 

In November 2018, the Company announced an agreement to acquire the Vibativ assets and assume global responsibility for the brand including the related marketing, distribution, manufacturing and regulatory activities. In early 2021, we introduced the Cumberland-packaged product, which is supported by our hospital sales force. 

Vibativ is a patented, FDA-approved injectable anti-infective. It is designed to treat serious infections due to Staphylococcus aureus (&#8220;S. Aureus") and other Gram-positive bacteria, including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (&#8220;MRSA&#8221;) and Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (&#8220;MSSA&#8221; ). Vibativ addresses a range of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including those that are considered difficult-to-treat and multidrug-resistant. 

Vibativ can serve as a potentially life-saving treatment in patients with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia resulting from infections including the flu, RSV and COVID-19. 

Pneumonia caused by secondary bacterial infections is common among patients with viral respiratory infections. Research shows that hospital-acquired pneumonia (&#8220;HAP&#8221;) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (&#8220;VAP&#8221;) have historically accounted for 22% of common hospital-acquired infections. MSSA and MRSA are important disease-causing pathogens in these cases. 

While many recently introduced antibiotics are quickly losing the battle to fight the bacteria they were designed to kill because those bacteria have become drug-resistant, Vibativ was specifically designed to kill drug-resistant bacteria. 

The molecule of an existing antibiotic to which bacteria had developed a resistance, vancomycin, was altered by adding a lipophilic (fat-loving) component and a hydrophilic (water-loving) component. The lipophilic addition increases Vibativ&#8217;s ability to penetrate the cell wall and inhibits the formation of new cell walls (the development of new and/or additional cell walls is the most common way that bacteria become resistant to drugs). The hydrophilic addition increases Vibativ&#8217;s penetration into tissue &#8211; so it is able to attack infections that are not reachable by other antibiotics. In comparison to vancomycin, Vibativ is 32 times more potent against MRSA strains when tested under in vitro conditions. Further, in clinical trials, Vibativ demonstrated superior cure rates of patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia. 

In 2023, we announced a new publication in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy detailing the results of the first clinical study investigating the safety and pharmacokinetics of our Vibativ product in children 2 to 17 years of age. The results of the study suggest that a single dose of Vibativ is safe in children and they experience reduced exposure to Vibativ, compared with the same body weight-based dosing in adults. 

While we remain focused on promoting Vibativ in the U.S. market, we are building a network of other established companies to bring Vibativ to patients in their countries and territories. In 2022, we announced a new partnership with Saudi Arabia-based Tabuk Pharmaceutical to introduce Vibativ into the Middle East. The arrangement provides Tabuk exclusive rights to distribute Vibativ in Saudi Arabia and Jordan, with the option to expand into other countries in the region. We recently began shipping Vibativ to Tabuk in preparation for their launch of the product in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, D.B. Pharm, our partner in South Korea who also distributes Caldolor, is awaiting the approval of Vibativ in their country. 

Meanwhile, our Vibativ partner for the Chinese market, SciClone Pharmaceuticals, had their approval application in China accepted for review in September 2021. We have since been supporting SciClone and their requests associated with review of that submission. They recently obtained that approval and believe that there is significant potential for Vibativ in their country. 

PIPELINE 

Ifetroban Clinical Studies 

Ifetroban is a selective thromboxane-prostanoid receptor (&#8220;TPr&#8221;) antagonist that has been dosed in over 1,400 subjects, demonstrating safety and well-tolerated profiles in both healthy volunteers and various patient populations. We are currently advancing two Phase II clinical programs evaluating ifetroban:1) treatment of Systemic Sclerosis (scleroderma), a debilitating autoimmune disorder characterized by diffuse fibrosis of the skin and internal organs, and 2) treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), the most common form of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease (PF-ILD). The FDA has cleared investigational new study applications for both indications, enabling the launch of clinical studies in each area. 

Additionally, we recently completed a Phase II study in patients with cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare, fatal genetic neuromuscular disease that results in deterioration of skeletal, heart and lung muscles. Next steps include further data analysis and completion of a full study report in preparation for an end-of-Phase-II meeting with the FDA to determine the development and commercialization pathway. 

We have also completed pilot Phase II studies in patients with 1) Hepatorenal Syndrome, a life-threatening condition involving liver and kidney failure, 2) Portal Hypertension associated with chronic liver disease and 3) Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease, a severe form of asthma. No significant safety issues were identified with ifetroban use in these patient populations. 

Multiple additional pilot studies of ifetroban are also currently in progress, including several investigator-initiated preclinical and clinical trials. 

Following is detailed information about our clinical programs evaluating ifetroban: 

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (&#8220;DMD&#8221;) 

In February of 2025, we announced positive top-line results from our Phase II study of oral ifetroban (Dyscorban &#174; ) for treating cardiomyopathy associated with DMD. The study marks a breakthrough as the first successful Phase II study specifically targeting the cardiac complications in DMD patients. Cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of death in DMD patients, and elevated levels of TPr and its ligand, isoprostanes, are found in these patients. 

The trial enrolled 41 DMD patients who received either low-dose ifetroban (100 mg per day), high-dose ifetroban (300 mg per day) or placebo. The study&#8217;s primary endpoint was improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (&#8220;LVEF&#8221;). Key findings include: 1) high-dose ifetroban treatment resulted in an overall 3.3% improvement in LVEF; 2) the high-dose ifetroban group showed a 1.8% increase in LVEF, while the placebo group showed an expected decline of 1.5%; 3) compared with propensity-matched natural history controls, the difference was more pronounced, with high-dose treatment providing a significant 5.4% overall improvement in LVEF, as control patients experienced a 3.6% decline and 4) both doses were well-tolerated, with no serious drug-related events. 

Preclinical studies by our Vanderbilt collaborators demonstrated TPr blockade by ifetroban prevented cardiac dysfunction and improved mortality in several animal models of muscular dystrophy. These results, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, suggest TPr activation contributes to DMD cardiomyopathy and blockade with ifetroban may serve as a novel therapeutic for DMD patients. 

The FDA has granted both Orphan Drug Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for ifetroban for the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with DMD. If approved, it would be the first therapy specifically indicated for the heart disease associated with DMD. 

Cumberland was awarded over $1 million in federal funding to support this clinical trial, the first DMD study awarded FDA Orphan Product Development funding. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s impact on clinical research in 2020, the FDA awarded a supplemental grant to support the study. 

Systemic Sclerosis (&#8220;SSc&#8221;) 

We are developing ifetroban oral capsules under the brand name Vasculan &#174; for treating Systemic sclerosis. SSc has the highest case-specific mortality of any rheumatic disorder, with 50% of patients dying or developing major internal organ complications within three years of diagnosis. While several medications treat SSc-associated skin disease, no universally effective treatment exists for improving affected internal organ function, including the cardiovascular system. 

Cardiac involvement in SSc is often underestimated due to its subtle and atypical presentation. Despite cardiovascular events contributing to elevated mortality in later disease stages, overt signs typically indicate advanced disease, including myocardial or pericardial inflammation, heart failure and pulmonary arterial hypertension (&#8220;PAH&#8221;). 

Our Vanderbilt collaborators completed preclinical studies demonstrating that TPr blockade with ifetroban prevents cardiac fibrosis and can restore cardiac function in PAH animal models. 

The FDA cleared our IND application for a 34-subject Phase II trial evaluating 12 months of oral ifetroban (Vasculan) in patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc, and those with SSc-associated PAH. The study is currently enrolling patients. 

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (&#8220;IPF&#8221;) 

In January 2024, we launched our FIGHTING FIBROSIS trial, a Phase II clinical study evaluating ifetroban for Progressive Fibrosing Interstitial Lung Diseases (&#8220;PF-ILDs&#8221;). The study is designed to enroll approximately 128 patients across more than 20 U.S. medical centers of excellence to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of oral ifetroban in IPF patients, the most common form of PF-ILD. This program is supported by studies published by our Vanderbilt collaborators which demonstrated ifetroban could both prevent and enhance resolution of lung fibrosis in multiple preclinical models. 

Future Development 

Our immediate focus is completing the Company-sponsored studies, analyzing their final data, and announcing top-line results. The comprehensive evaluation will inform our strategy for the registration pathway for ifetroban, Cumberland&#8217;s first new chemical entity. We continue to believe ifetroban has significant potential to benefit patients with orphan diseases representing substantial unmet medical needs. 

GROWTH STRATEGY 

Cumberland&#8217;s growth strategy involves maximizing the potential of our existing brands, while continuing to build a portfolio of differentiated products. We currently own six products approved by the FDA in the United States. We are also building international partnerships to bring our medicines to patients in other countries. Additionally, we look for opportunities to expand our brands into new patient populations through clinical trials, new product presentations and our support of select, investigator-initiated studies. Meanwhile, our clinical team is developing a pipeline of new product candidates to address poorly met medical needs. We also pursue opportunities to acquire additional marketed brands, as well as late-stage development product candidates in our target medical specialties. 

We are supplementing these activities with the earlier-stage product development at Cumberland Emerging Technologies ("CET"), our majority-owned subsidiary. CET partners with academic research institutions to identify and support the progress of promising new product candidates, which Cumberland can further develop and commercialize. 

Specifically, we are seeking long-term, sustainable growth by: 

&#8226; Supporting and expanding the use of our marketed products. We continue to evaluate our products following their FDA approval to determine if additional clinical data could expand their market and use. For example, we have secured pediatric approval of Acetadote and Caldolor and expanded the labeling for both brands accordingly. We also added pre-surgery dosing for Caldolor, and recently included newborns to the patients who can benefit from the product. 

&#8226; Selectively adding complementary brands. In addition to our product development activities, we are also seeking to acquire approved brands or late-stage development product candidates to continue to build our portfolio. We seek under-promoted, FDA-approved drugs as well as late-stage development products that can improve patient care. We will continue to target product acquisition candidates that are competitively differentiated and have valuable intellectual property or other protective features. Our acquisitions of Vibativ and Sancuso are examples of the implementation of this strategy. 

&#8226; Progressing our clinical pipeline and incubating future product opportunities at CET. We believe it is important to build a pipeline of innovative new product opportunities, as we are doing through our ifetroban Phase II development programs. We are also supplementing our acquisitions and late-stage development activities with the early-stage product development activities at CET. 

&#8226; Leveraging our infrastructure through co-promotion partnerships. We believe that our commercial infrastructure can help drive prescription volume and product sales. We also look for strategic partners that can complement our capabilities and enhance opportunities for our brands. For example, our co-promotion partnerships have allowed us to expand the support for Kristalose across the United States. 

&#8226; Building an international contribution to our business. We have established our own commercial capabilities, including three sales divisions, that focus on the U.S. market for our products. We are also working with a network of select international partners to register our products and make them available to patients in their countries. We will continue to support our partners&#8217; registration and commercialization efforts in their respective territories. The acquisition of Vibativ resulted in several new international partners and market opportunities. 

&#8226; Managing our operations with financial discipline. We continually work to manage our expenses in line with our revenues, to deliver positive cash flow from operations. We seek to maintain favorable gross margins and a strong balance sheet. 

SALES AND MARKETING 

Cumberland&#8217;s sales and marketing team has broad industry experience in selling branded pharmaceuticals. Our sales and marketing executives direct our national marketing campaigns and maintain key national account relationships. They also manage our dedicated hospital, field and oncology sales forces, which are comprised of approximately 60 sales professionals. 

&#8226; Hospital market: We promote Caldolor and Vibativ through our dedicated hospital sales division. This organization targets key hospitals across the U.S. and is comprised of sales professionals with substantial experience in the hospital market. Independent market data continues to indicate that the majority of pharmaceutical promotional spending is directed toward large, outpatient markets on drugs intended for chronic use rather than short-term, hospital use. 

We believe the hospital market is underserved and highly concentrated, and that it can be penetrated effectively by a small, dedicated sales force without large-scale promotional activity. Our established position in the hospital market provided the rationale for adding Vibativ as our first infectious disease product that complements our hospital product line. Our strategy has been to focus our hospital sales team on select, high-priority accounts. 

&#8226; Gastroenterology market: We promote Kristalose through a dedicated field sales team addressing a targeted group of physicians who are existing and potential large prescribers of the product. Because the market for gastrointestinal diseases is broad in patient scope, yet relatively narrow in physician base, we believe it provides opportunities that can be penetrated with a modest-sized sales force. We also believe that we can increase market share for Kristalose through our co-promotion and marketing initiatives. 

&#8226; Oncology market: In early 2022, we formed a new oncology sales force to promote our Sancuso brand. This organization targets key oncologists and clinics across the U.S. and is comprised of both inside and field-based sales professionals. During 2023, we expanded the sales division as we work to deliver Sancuso to more cancer patients, helping them tolerate their chemotherapy treatments. 

Our commercial executives conduct ongoing analyses to evaluate marketing campaigns and promotional programs in support of our brands. The evaluations include development of product profiles, testing of the profiles against the needs of the market, determining what additional product information or development work is needed to effectively market the products and preparing financial forecasts. We utilize professional branding and packaging as well as promotional items to support our products, including direct mail, promotional aides, journal advertising, educational and reminder leave-behinds, patient educational pieces, coupons and product sampling. We also regularly attend select medical meetings and trade shows to expand the awareness of our products. 

Our national accounts team is responsible for key large buyers and related marketing programs. We also maintain relationships with our wholesaler customers, third-party payors, group purchasing organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, hospital buying groups, outpatient centers, state and federal government purchasers, and health insurance companies.

BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT 

Since inception, we have had an active business development initiative focused on acquiring rights to marketed products and product candidates that fit our strategy and target markets. We source business development opportunities through our international network of advisory firms and individual pharmaceutical industry and medical advisors. A multi-disciplinary internal management team reviews these opportunities on a regular basis using a group of selection criteria. We have historically focused on product opportunities that are a strategic fit with our commercial organization, development expertise and medical focus, employing a variety of transaction structures. 

We have continued to build our product portfolio of complementary, niche brands largely through product acquisitions and late-stage development of product candidates. 

Our primary targets are under-promoted, FDA-approved drugs with existing brand recognition and late-stage development product candidates that address unmet or poorly met medical needs in the hospital acute care, gastroenterology and oncology markets. We believe that by focusing mainly on approved or late-stage products, we can minimize the significant risk, cost and time associated with drug development. 

We continue to strategically review our brands, pipeline and capabilities, as well as our international partners. We believe that it is prudent to continually evaluate our product portfolio, partners, and organization in order to ensure a proper focus and the needed supporting capabilities. 

International Partners 

D.B. Pharm Korea Co., Ltd. (&#8220;D.B. Pharm&#8221;) has licensed our Caldolor product for the South Korean market, and they obtained regulatory approval for Caldolor in their country. During 2024, D.B. Pharm continued to purchase supplies of Caldolor and distributed the brand in South Korea. We have also entered into agreements with D.B. Pharm to register and commercialize our Vaprisol and Vibativ brands in their country. During 2024, we worked with them to prepare the submissions for the approval of each brand there. They are currently pursuing the approval of Vibativ in their country. 

We have executed a license and distribution agreement with HongKong WinHealth Pharma Group Co. Limited (&#8220;WinHealth&#8221;) for our Caldolor and Acetadote brands in China and Hong Kong. Under the terms of the agreement, WinHealth will provide development milestone payments and purchase supplies of the products following their registration in China. 

We also entered into a strategic alliance agreement with WinHealth to explore future business opportunities that will further the mission and goals of each organization. Founded in Hangzhou, China and currently headquartered in Hong Kong, WinHealth has developed a wide breadth of capabilities, including drug licensing, product development and registration, and has established a strong network of distribution and sales promotional capabilities for the Chinese market. WinHealth has established partnerships with international companies that include Boehringer-Ingelheim, Janssen, Novartis, Pfizer and Roche, generating several hundred million dollars in sales annually.

In February 2021, SciClone completed an initial public offering and listing of their shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange. In June 2021, SciClone submitted an application to the Chinese regulatory authority for the approval of Vibativ in that country. In October 2021, SciClone informed us that the filing was accepted by the regulatory agency for review. We have since been supporting SciClone and their requests associated with review of that submission. They recently obtained that approval and believe that there is significant potential for Vibativ in their country. 

In March 2022, we established distribution for our Vibativ product in the Middle East through a partnership with Tabuk Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Company (&#8220;Tabuk&#8221;). Through our partnership, Tabuk will introduce the product in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and potentially other countries in the Middle East. They have ordered initial supplies of Vibativ and are currently planning the launch of the product in Saudi Arabia. 

In October 2022, we announced an agreement with PiSA Pharmaceutical for the registration and commercialization of Caldolor in Mexico. Under the terms of the agreement, Cumberland will be responsible for providing the product dossier and supplies. PiSA will be responsible for obtaining regulatory approval for the product in Mexico and introducing it to the new market. In 2024, they competed the submission of the approval dossier to Mexico&#8217;s regulatory agency, for the product&#8217;s registration in that country. 

Poly Co-Promotion Agreement 

We entered into a co-promotion arrangement with Poly Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;Poly&#8221;) for our Kristalose product in 2017. Poly is a privately held U.S. specialty pharmaceutical company that is featuring Kristalose to an expanded number of physicians. Poly&#8217;s sales organization is more than doubling the number of nationwide physicians that are reached with the Kristalose brand message. In 2019, we extended our co-promotion arrangement with Poly. 

2R and Foxland Agreements 

In 2018, we entered into another co-promotion arrangement related to our Kristalose product. We have agreements with 2R Investments, LLC and with Foxland Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;Foxland&#8221;) to package, distribute and promote an unbranded generic form of our Kristalose product to physician targets that we do not cover. We renewed our agreement with Foxland in 2022. 

CET University Collaboration Agreements 

Through CET, we collaborate with a select group of academic research institutions located in the Mid-South region of the U.S. to identify, co-develop and seek grant funding for promising biomedical technologies emerging from those research institutions. CET is collaborating with Vanderbilt University and other regional academic research institutions and has entered into a series of agreements to access and collaborate on the development of innovative product candidates. These arrangements enable CET to team with university-based researchers to advance their scientific discoveries and breakthroughs by designing new product candidates to improve patient care and address unmet medical needs. CET has been able to help secure federal small business grant funding to support these various projects. 

CET has also established and manages the Nashville Life Sciences Center , which serves as an incubator for Middle Tennessee&#8217;s emerging biomedical industry. The Life Sciences Center provides offices, laboratory space, and equipment to early-stage companies looking to develop their technologies and products. We maintain the Cumberland Pharmaceuticals formulation and testing laboratory at the CET Life Sciences Center. 

Nearly 30 life science companies exist today because of CET, including a vibrant group of current tenants at the Life Sciences Center as well as a growing number of successful graduates. 

During 2024 there were two key developments among the programs CET is supporting. 

First, enrollment concluded and top-line results have become available for the MENDING Trial, a Phase II investigator-initiated study evaluating the safety and efficacy of a new treatment for delirium in critically ill patients. The study was conducted in partnership with Vanderbilt University Medical Center and funded by the National Institute of Health (&#8220;NIH&#8221;). The MENDING Trial enrolled 97 critically ill patients who were admitted to the Vanderbilt Intensive Care Unit (&#8220;ICU&#8221;) for treatment of respiratory failure or shock and treated 39 who, while in the ICU, developed delirium. Delirious patients received twice-daily IV treatment or placebo and were evaluated over the course of 14 days. 

The primary endpoint for this study was the safety of this new treatment. The study also evaluated patient days without delirium or coma. Additional endpoints included ventilator-free days; hospital-free days; drug exposure for antipsychotics, opioids, and sedatives; and cognitive function. The MENDING Trial successfully demonstrated that the new treatment was well-tolerated in these ICU patients diagnosed with delirium. In addition the new treatment was associated with 1) a reduction in days with delirium; 2) reduced use of antipsychotics, opioids, and sedatives; and 3) a decrease in delirious patients experiencing comas. While the efficacy results were not statistically significant given the limited number of patients treated, the findings are considered clinically meaningful by physician investigators involved in the study and support continued development. 

Delirium is characterized as a serious alteration in mental state which may present with confusion, poor attention or lack of awareness. Additionally, delirium is the most common presentation of neurologic dysfunction in critically ill patients and affects between 30-75% of patients admitted to the ICU. Development of delirium is associated with several poor outcomes including increased length of hospital stays, long-term cognitive deficits, additional hospital costs, impaired quality of life and mortality. Despite the prevalence and impact of delirium, there are currently no FDA-approved therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of delirium, highlighting an unmet medical need for these patients. 

Second, CET entered into a Development Agreement with Octapharma AG ("Octapharma") for a new product designed to locate sites of internal bleeding. In exchange for an option to worldwide rights to the technology, Octapharma will provide development funding. With the option exercise, Octapharma will also provide milestone payments and royalties on product sales. 

Most clinically significant internal bleeding occurs in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, especially the lower tract. Intestinal hemorrhage ranks among conditions having the highest number of all-cause readmissions and among the most common causes of nonmalignant mortality. Current treatment for GI hemorrhage begins with identifying the bleeding site through diagnostic testing. Colonoscopy is the recommended first-line diagnostic procedure, while computed tomographic angiography is advised for a subset of high-risk patients who are unlikely to tolerate bowel preparation. Both angiography and tagged red blood cell scintigraphy &#8211; older, less commonly used tests &#8211; require a minimum rate of active bleeding for accurate results. Diagnosis using colonoscopy is also more challenging without active bleeding or when excessive bleeding obscures the visual field. 

The new technology represents a paradigm shift as it identifies the naturally formed clot at the injured vessels, allowing for the potential to pinpoint GI bleeding sites even if bleeding has ceased temporarily. The product is designed as a proprietary radiochemical preparatory kit for generating a medical imaging agent for injection. It has been developed through a collaboration between CET, researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Cold Springs Diagnostics, Inc. The development has been supported by an NIH grant awarded to CET under the STTR program. The next steps include scaling up the drug formulation and conducting the additional preclinical testing needed to file and obtain clearance for an Investigational New Drug application, paving the way for an initial clinical study.

In addition to coordinating the call center, our clinical/regulatory group generates medical information letters, provides informational memos to our sales forces and assists with ongoing training for the sales forces. 

CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT AND STUDY RESULTS 

Vibativ Clinical Manuscripts 

Vibativ is a patented, FDA-approved injectable anti-infective for the treatment of certain serious bacterial infections including hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections. It addresses a range of Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including those that are considered difficult-to-treat and multidrug-resistant. 

In October 2023, Cumberland announced a new study published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy detailing the results of the first clinical study investigating the safety and pharmacokinetics of our Vibativ (telavancin) product in children 2 to 17 years of age. The study found a single 10 mg/kg dose of Vibativ was safe with no serious adverse events or renal concerns. Drug exposure to Vibativ was lower in children compared with the same body weight-based dosing in adults. The study suggests Vibativ is a safe and viable option for pediatric patients ages 2 to 17 who require systemic antibiotics for the treatment of a known or suspected bacterial infection, including those with MRSA or another S. aureus pathogen. 

Caldolor Newborn Study, Clinical Manuscripts and Other Studies 

We previously received FDA approval for the use of Caldolor in pediatric patients 6 months of age and older. Caldolor is the first and only injectable NSAID approved for use in children. We then initiated a study to collect data on the use of Caldolor in children ranging in age from birth up to 6 months of age. Enrollment in that multi-center study was completed in 2019, and topline results were announced in 2020, indicating that Caldolor was well tolerated in this patient population, with no safety concerns noted. 

In May 2023, we announced the FDA approval of Caldolor in pediatric patients 3 to 6 months of age. With this newly approved labeling, Caldolor is the only non-opioid injectable product approved to treat pain in infants that is delivered through injection. 

Additionally, in June 2023, we shared the positive results from a clinical study investigating the safety and pharmacokinetics of Caldolor in newborns, published in the journal Pediatric Drugs . The clinical study evaluated the safety and drug exposure profile of Caldolor in 24 hospitalized infants between the ages of 1 and 6 months who required treatment for pain or fever. Of the 24 patients included in the study, three were under 3 months of age, and the remaining 21 patients were 3 to 6 months of age. Twenty patients received a single dose, and four patients received multiple doses. In this study, single and multiple 10 mg/kg doses of Caldolor were reported safe, with no drug-related adverse events or renal concerns. Drug exposure following a single dose of Caldolor in infants 1 to 6 months of age was similar to what was previously reported in older children. The results of this study support the growing body of evidence that demonstrates Caldolor is a safe therapeutic option available to practitioners for the treatment of fever and pain in infants, children and adults. 

In 2024, we announced the publication of new real-world outcomes research involving 150,000 patients, which compared our Caldolor to its key competitor &#8211; ketorolac. The results provided compelling evidence that Caldolor is associated with a significantly reduced incidence of adverse drug reactions and also improved healthcare utilization. 

Additionally, in March of 2024, a Caldolor Special Report was published in Anesthesiology News , General Surgery News and Pharmacy Practice News that presented the growing amount of data supporting the use of Caldolor as a standard of care for the treatment of pain and fever. The results demonstrated that the product is a safe and effective treatment for pain and fever in adults, children and infants as young as 3 months of age. 

Ifetroban Phase II Studies 

We have been evaluating our ifetroban product candidate in a series of clinical studies. We have two Phase II clinical programs underway evaluating our ifetroban product candidate in 1) Systemic Sclerosis or scleroderma, a debilitating autoimmune disorder characterized by diffuse fibrosis of the skin and internal organs and 2) patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, the most common form of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease. Investigational new study applications have been cleared by the FDA enabling us to launch clinical studies in each of these areas. Additionally, we recently completed a Phase II study in patients with cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy , a rare, fatal, genetic neuromuscular disease that results in deterioration of the skeletal, heart and lung muscles. Next steps include further data analysis and completion of a full study report in preparation for an end-of-Phase-II meeting with the FDA to determine next steps associated with the product&#8217;s development and commercialization. 

We have also completed a pilot Phase II study involving 1) patients suffering from Hepatorenal Syndrome, a life-threatening condition involving liver and kidney failure, 2) patients with Portal Hypertension associated with chronic liver disease and 3) patients with Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease, a severe form of asthma. There were no significant safety issues identified with the use of ifetroban in these patients. 

Additional pilot studies of ifetroban are underway, including several investigator-initiated trials. 

We are awaiting results from the studies underway before deciding on the best development path for the registration of ifetroban, our first new chemical entity. 

Additional Testing Program 

Cumberland entered into a non-clinical evaluation agreement, to test one of our products against bacterial strains and subsequently, in vivo animal models utilizing the preclinical services program funded by the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (&#8220;DMID&#8221;), which is part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (&#8220;NIAID&#8221;), an institute of the National Institutes of Health (&#8220;NIH&#8221;), which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;HHS&#8221;), an agency of the U.S. government. The NIAID contractors completed these studies and prepared a manuscript for submission to a scientific journal for publication. 

CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT 

Cumberland Pharma Foundation 

We have formed the Cumberland Pharma Foundation (the &#8220;Foundation&#8221;) to provide the ongoing philanthropic endeavors of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. 

The Foundation was formed as an independent, nonprofit corporation designed to qualify as a tax-exempt organization pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Foundation&#8217;s Board of Directors is comprised of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals executives who are responsible for overseeing the Foundation&#8217;s ongoing activities, including charitable contributions. 

We initially provided a grant of 50,000 shares of our common stock to the Foundation. The shares will address the ongoing financial needs of the Foundation, with most of the shares expected to be held for the opportunity to realize long-term appreciation to support the Foundation&#8217;s future. 

The Foundation maintains independent financial statements and its contributions will not impact the financial statements of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals. Initial annual grants by the Foundation have been and remain consistent with the historic level of contributions made by Cumberland Pharmaceuticals. 

Cumberland Health and Wellness Political Action Committee 

We have also formed the Cumberland Health and Wellness Political Action Committee (the &#8220;PAC&#8221;). The objective of the PAC is to support candidates and policies that are consistent with Cumberland&#8217;s mission of advancing patient care. The PAC&#8217;s activities are held at a local, state, and federal level and conducted in a bi-partisan manner. 

The initial committee membership is comprised of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals employees. The PAC received initial funding from us, and future funding will include voluntary individual contributions from Cumberland Pharmaceuticals directors and employees. 

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION 

Manufacturing 

We partner with third parties for certain non-core, capital-intensive capabilities, including the manufacturing and distribution of our products. We manage these third-party relationships and are responsible for the quality review and release of each lot of our products. 

Acetadote &#174; 

We have an agreement with one manufacturer, who provided commercial supplies of Acetadote in 2024. 

Caldolor &#174; 

We have agreements with multiple manufacturers for the supply of Caldolor and during 2024, we obtained commercial supplies from three of these manufacturers for our international and domestic Caldolor requirements. 

Kristalose &#174; 

We have an agreement for the purchase of Kristalose API with an international supplier. We also had manufacturing arrangements with a packager who provided finished supplies of the product for commercial and sampling purposes during 2024. 

Sancuso &#174; 

As part of the acquisition of Sancuso, we obtained an initial supply of finished goods inventory. The agreement with the manufacturer of Sancuso was assigned to us and there were additional goods supplied to us during 2022. The production was moved to one of the manufacturer&#8217;s other facilities. During 2022, that new facility was approved by the FDA to manufacture and supply Sancuso. We received supplies of the product from the new facility in 2023 and began shipping the Cumberland-packaged product during 2024. 

Vaprisol &#174; 

As part of the acquisition of Vaprisol, we obtained a significant existing supply of raw material inventory. We reached an agreement during 2020 with a new manufacturer to provide us with long-term supplies of the product. We subsequently completed the transfer of the product&#8217;s manufacturing to the new facility in 2021. We informed the FDA that supplies of the product are not currently available and are awaiting approval for that new facility. Our new manufacturing partner is working with the FDA to address several Form 483 and warning letter issues in a timely manner. They have successfully produced Vaprisol in their facility and we look forward to relaunching the brand once the FDA clears our submission to manufacture it in the new facility. Meanwhile, our partner is providing a special supply of compounded product in support of critically ill patients. 

Vibativ &#174; 

Through our acquisition of Vibativ, we obtained a multi-year supply of raw material, work in process and finished goods inventory. As a result of the agreement, we are now responsible for the future manufacturing of the product. We completed the transfer of the product&#8217;s manufacturing activities to a new supplier and received FDA approval for that facility. During 2024, we launched a new, smaller package for our Vibativ product. This additional presentation is designed to overcome a barrier at smaller hospitals and infusion centers that use less of the product at a time, allowing them to better manage their costs and the workflow associated with the product. 

Distribution 

Like many pharmaceutical companies, we engage a third-party with appropriate facilities and logistical expertise to support the U.S. distribution of our products. In 2024, Cardinal Health Specialty Solutions exclusively handled our U.S. product logistics activities, including warehousing, shipping, and various other customer activities. Our primary customers are the wholesalers of pharmaceuticals who provide our products to hospitals, clinics and retail pharmacies in the U.S. 

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPRIETARY RIGHTS 

We own the trademarks for each of our branded pharmaceutical products as well as for our corporate name and logo. We have applied for trademark registration for other various names and logos. Over time, we intend to maintain registrations on trademarks that remain valuable to our business. 

We seek to protect our products from competition through a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, FDA exclusivity and contractual restrictions on disclosure. Proprietary rights, including patents, are an important element of our business. We seek to protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute agreements providing for protection of our confidential information upon commencement of their employment or engagement. We also require confidentiality agreements from entities to which we provide our confidential information or materials. 

Acetadote &#174; 

We developed a new formulation of Acetadote (acetylcysteine) injection as part of a Phase IV commitment in response to a request by the FDA to evaluate the reduction of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (&#8220;EDTA&#8221;) from the product&#8217;s formulation. In April 2012, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,148,356 (the &#8220;356 Acetadote Patent&#8221;) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 356 Acetadote Patent encompass the new Acetadote formulation and include composition of matter claims. Following its issuance, the 356 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book. The 356 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in May 2026, which includes a 270-day patent term adjustment granted by the USPTO. 

Following the issuance of the 356 Acetadote Patent, we received separate Paragraph IV certification notices from InnoPharma, Inc. (&#8220;InnoPharma&#8221;), Paddock Laboratories, LLC (&#8220;Paddock&#8221;), Mylan Institutional LLC (&#8220;Mylan&#8221;), Sagent Agila LLC (&#8220;Sagent&#8221;) and Perrigo Company (&#8220;Perrigo&#8221;) challenging the 356 Acetadote Patent on the basis of non-infringement and/or invalidity. We responded by filing five separate infringement lawsuits, in the appropriate United States District Courts, to contest each of the challenges. 

On November 12, 2012, we entered into a Settlement Agreement (the &#8220;Settlement Agreement&#8221;) with Paddock and Perrigo to resolve the challenges and the pending litigation with those two companies. 

On November 1, 2013, the United States District Courts filed opinions granting Sagent&#8217;s and InnoPharma&#8217;s motions to dismiss our suits and we agreed not to file an appeal or motion to reconsider, thereby resolving the challenges and the pending litigation with those two companies. 

Under the Settlement Agreement, Paddock and Perrigo admit that the 356 Acetadote Patent is valid and enforceable and that any Paddock or Perrigo generic version of Acetadote (with or without EDTA) would infringe upon the 356 Acetadote Patent. In addition, Paddock and Perrigo will not challenge the validity, enforceability, ownership or patentability of the 356 Acetadote Patent through its expiration currently scheduled for May 2026. On November 12, 2012, in connection with the execution of the Settlement Agreement, we entered into a License and Supply Agreement with Paddock and Perrigo (the &#8220;License and Supply Agreement&#8221;). 

Under the terms of the License and Supply Agreement, if a third party receives final approval from the FDA for an ANDA to sell a generic Acetadote product and such third party made such generic version available for purchase in commercial quantities in the United States, we are to supply Perrigo with an Authorized Generic version of our Acetadote product. 

On May 18, 2012, we also submitted a Citizen Petition to the FDA requesting that the FDA refrain from approving any applications for acetylcysteine injection that contain EDTA, based in part on the FDA&#8217;s request that we evaluate the reduction or removal of EDTA from our original Acetadote formulation. 

On November 7, 2012, the FDA responded to the Citizen Petition denying our request and on November 8, 2012, we learned that the FDA approved the ANDA referencing Acetadote filed by InnoPharma, Inc. We brought suit against the FDA contesting the FDA&#8217;s decision to approve the InnoPharma generic on November 13, 2012. 

On September 30, 2013, the United States District Court filed an opinion granting a summary judgment in favor of the FDA regarding this suit. 

As noted above, during 2012 the FDA approved the ANDA referencing Acetadote filed by InnoPharma, Inc. Upon this condition, in accordance with the License and Supply agreement with Perrigo, we began to supply Perrigo with our Authorized Generic. On January 7, 2013, Perrigo announced initial distribution of our Authorized Generic acetylcysteine injection product. 

On March 19, 2013, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,399,445 (the &#8220;445 Acetadote Patent&#8221;) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 445 Acetadote Patent encompass the use of the 200 mg/ml Acetadote formulation to treat patients with acetaminophen overdose. On April 8, 2013, the 445 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book. The 445 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in August 2025.

Remaining Products 

We have no issued patents for our Sancuso, Vaprisol or Kristalose products. We have multiple granted patents relating to our ifetroban products and patent applications pending with the USPTO. 

COMPETITION 

The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our continued success in developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products will depend, in part, upon our ability to compete against existing and future products in our target markets. Competitive factors directly affecting our markets include but are not limited to: 

&#8226; product attributes such as efficacy, safety, ease-of-use and cost-effectiveness; 

&#8226; brand awareness and recognition driven by sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; 

&#8226; intellectual property and other exclusivity rights; 

&#8226; availability of resources to build and maintain developmental and commercial capabilities; 

&#8226; successful business development activities; 

&#8226; extent of third-party reimbursements, insurance coverage; and 

&#8226; establishment of advantageous collaborations to conduct development, manufacturing or commercialization efforts. 

A number of our competitors possess research and development and sales and marketing capabilities as well as financial resources greater than ours. These competitors, in addition to emerging companies and academic research institutions, may be developing, or in the future could develop, new technologies that could compete with our current and future products or render our products obsolete. 

Our products face competition from other branded products, generics and alternate medical treatments. Our task is to position each brand to feature its competitive advantages, implement a well thought out marketing plan and provide focused sales, field based medical and other tactical support. 

Acetadote &#174; 

Acetadote is our injectable formulation of N-acetylcysteine ( &#8220; NAC&#8221;) for the treatment of acetaminophen overdose. NAC is accepted worldwide as the standard of care for acetaminophen overdose. Our competitors in the acetaminophen overdose market are those companies selling orally administered NAC including, but not limited to, Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bedford Laboratories division of Hikma Pharmaceuticals, Roxane Laboratories, Inc., InnoPharma Inc. and Hospira Inc. 

In November 2012, InnoPharma Inc. was granted approval by the FDA to distribute their generic form of the old formulation of Acetadote containing EDTA. In late 2012, we entered into the Settlement Agreement with Paddock and Perrigo that included the right to distribute our Authorized Generic Acetadote injection product. Our branded Acetadote now competes with both the EDTA-free Authorized Generic Acetadote distributed by Paddock and Perrigo along with generic Acetadote products that contain EDTA. 

There are multiple manufacturers of injectable NAC products that are based on our old formulation. 

Caldolor &#174; 

Caldolor is marketed for the treatment of pain and fever, primarily in a hospital or surgery center setting. A variety of other products address the acute pain market: 

&#8226; Morphine, the most commonly used product for the treatment of acute, post-operative pain, is manufactured and distributed by several generic pharmaceutical companies; 

&#8226; Other generic injectable opioids, including fentanyl, meperidine and hydromorphone, address this market; 

&#8226; Ketorolac tromethamine (brand name Toradol &#174; ), an injectable NSAID, is also manufactured and distributed by several generic pharmaceutical companies; 

&#8226; IV acetaminophen (brand name Ofirmev &#174; ), an injectable analgesic product is sold by Mallinckrodt plc, and there are also generic versions from different manufacturers available; 

&#8226; Bupivacaine and meloxicam extended release solution (brand name Zynrelef &#174; ), is a dual-acting anesthetic for postoperative pain sold by Heron Therapeutics; 

&#8226; Oliceridine injection (brand name Olinvyk &#174; ), is an opioid agonist, a new chemical entity in the acute surgical postoperative pain market, sold by Trevena, Inc.; 

&#8226; Bupivacaine injectable suspension (brand name Exparel &#174; ), a product sold by Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., along with two additional bupivacaine products, Xaracoll and Posimir, which were more recently approved; and 

&#8226; Acetaminophen and ibuprofen combination injection (brand name Combogesic &#174; ), is a combination of acetaminophen and ibuprofen approved by the U.S. FDA in October 2023, and is sold by Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC. 

&#8226; Suzetrigine oral tablets (brand name Journavx &#174; ), a product sold by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a non-opioid pain signal inhibitor approved by the U.S. FDA in January 2025. 

We are aware of other product candidates in development to treat acute pain, including injectable NSAIDs, novel opioids, new formulations of existing therapies and extended release anesthetics. We believe non-narcotic analgesics for the treatment of post-surgical pain are the primary potential competitors to Caldolor. 

In addition to the injectable analgesic products above, many companies are developing analgesics for specific indications such as migraine and neuropathic pain, oral extended-release forms of existing narcotic and non-narcotic products, as well as those with new methods of delivery such as transdermal. We are not aware of any approved injectable products indicated for the treatment of fever in the U.S. other than Caldolor and Ofirmev. 

There are, however, numerous drugs available to physicians to reduce fevers in hospital settings via oral and rectal administration to the patient, including ibuprofen, acetaminophen and aspirin. These drugs are manufactured by numerous pharmaceutical companies. 

Kristalose &#174; 

Kristalose is a dry powder crystalline prescription formulation of lactulose indicated for the treatment of constipation. The U.S. constipation therapy market includes various prescription and over the counter, or OTC, products. The branded prescription products which we believe are our primary competitors are: 

&#8226; Lubiproston (brand name Amitiza &#174; ), an oral product indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in adults, is manufactured and sold by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals. 

&#8226; Naloxegol (brand name Movantik &#174; ), an oral product indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in adults with chronic non-cancer pain. It was acquired by RedHill Biopharma in the first quarter of 2020. 

&#8226; Linaclotide (brand name Linzess &#174; ), an oral product indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation. It is sold by Allergan, Inc. and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 

&#8226; Plecanatide (brand name Trulance &#174; ), an oral product indicated for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation. It is sold by Synergy Pharmaceuticals. 

&#8226; Generic and branded liquid lactulose products are marketed by a number of pharmaceutical companies. 

&#8226; Lactitol for oral solution (brand name Pizensy &#174; ), an oral, osmotic laxative indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation. It is distributed by Braintree Laboratories, Inc. and was recently approved by the FDA. 

&#8226; Vibrant Gastro (brand name Vibrant &#174; ) an orally administered drug-free capsule to enhance colonic motility via mechanical stimulation of the colon. 

There are several hundred OTC products used to treat constipation marketed by numerous pharmaceutical and consumer health companies. MiraLax (polyethylene glycol 3350), previously a prescription product, was indicated for the treatment of constipation and manufactured and marketed by Bayer. MiraLax was converted to an OTC product in February 2007 and recently, the FDA rescinded the approval of the generic prescription polyethylene glycol 3350 products. 

Sancuso &#174; 

Sancuso is the only transdermal patch FDA approved for the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (&#8220;CINV&#8221;). Each patch delivers up to five days of treatment with granisetron, a standard of care for CINV, through the skin. Recommended treatment suggests the patch be applied 24 to 48 hours prior to chemotherapy treatment and remain in place for five days. 

While there are no other transdermal products available to treat CINV, there is a large number of generic and branded oral products as well as a limited number of injectables. Cumberland considers the oral branded products to be the most important competition including Akynzeo; Emend &#174; Oral (manufactured by Merck); Varubi &#174; (branded NK1 receptor antagonist sold by Tesaro Inc. a division of GSK); Zuplenz &#174; (a branded version of Ondansetron marketed by Par Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and Kytril &#174; (a branded version of injectable granisetron hydrochloride manufactured by Roche Pharmaceuticals Inc.). 

Vaprisol &#174; 

Vaprisol is a patented, prescription brand indicated to raise serum sodium levels in hospitalized patients with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. The product was developed and registered by Astellas and then launched in 2006. It is one of two branded prescription products indicated for the treatment of hyponatremia, and the first and only intravenously administered branded treatment. The other competing product is Samsca &#174; (an oral tolvaptan product sold by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Company). There are also several generic versions of tolvaptan sold by other companies. 

Vibativ &#174; 

Vibativ is a potent, once-daily, injectable antibiotic for the treatment of certain gram-positive infections. Vibativ is approved for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections and hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia caused by susceptible isolates of Staphylococcus aureus when alternative treatments are not suitable. There are several generic and branded antibiotics that compete for these indications. 

The major generic competitors are vancomycin, linezolid and daptomycin. Vancomycin is by far the most widely used agent. Newer branded agents are also available, including: 

&#8226; Ceftaroline fosamil (brand name Teflaro &#174; ), an injectable antibiotic manufactured and sold by Allergan; 

&#8226; Ceftolozane/Tazobactam (brand name Zerbaxa &#174; ), a combination cephalosporin and beta-lactamase inhibitor manufactured and sold by Merck; 

&#8226; Omadacycline (brand name Nuzyra &#174; ), a new tetracycline approved in October 2018 and sold by Paratek Pharmaceuticals Inc.; 

&#8226; Dalbavancin (brand name Dalvance &#174; ), an injectable antibiotic manufactured and sold by Allergan; 

&#8226; Oritavancin (brand name Orbactiv &#174; ), an injectable antibiotic manufactured and sold by Melinta; and 

&#8226; Ceftobripole (brand name Zevetera), an injectable antibiotic registered in 2024 by Basilea. 

We are also aware of a number of other novel antibiotics that are currently in development. 

Antibiotic drug selection is based both on an empiric and susceptibility proven basis. In the hospital setting, cost is an important factor which favors the use of generic agents if they are effective. Newer agents are often reserved for two reasons: they are valuable in the treatment of patients that fail to respond to generics and it is considered good practice to conserve the use of these agents to reduce the risk of resistance. antimicrobial resistance, which is considered a global public health threat by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (&#8220;CDC&#8221;). 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

The development of new pharmaceutical products can be a long, expensive and risky process. There is no assurance we will obtain successful study results or secure the market approvals needed for our pipeline product candidates. Governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products. For more information, see "Risks Relating to Government Regulation" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 

In the U.S., the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDCA&#8221;), the Public Health Service Act, and other federal statutes and regulations, subjects pharmaceutical products to rigorous review. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications (&#8220;NDAs&#8221;) or biologics license applications (&#8220;BLAs&#8221;), warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 

We, our manufacturers and contract research organizations may also be subject to regulations under other federal, state and local laws, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, and import, export and customs regulations as well as the laws and regulations of other countries. 

FDA Approval Process 

The FDA is a regulatory agency within the Department of Health and Human Services. One of their key responsibilities is to regulate the safety and effectiveness of drugs sold in the United States. The FDA manages this responsibility in two phases: pre-approval (pre-market) and post approval (post-market). The FDA reviews manufacturers' applications to market drugs in the United States; a drug may not be sold unless it has FDA approval. The FDA continues its oversight of drug safety and effectiveness as long as the drug is on the market. 

To market a prescription drug in the United States, a manufacturer needs FDA approval. To get that approval, the manufacturer must demonstrate the drug's safety and effectiveness according to criteria specified in law and agency regulations, ensure that its manufacturing plant passes FDA inspection, and obtain FDA approval for the drug's labeling, a term that includes all written material about the drug, including, for example, packaging, prescribing information for physicians and patient brochures. 

The progression to drug approval begins before FDA involvement. First, scientists work in the laboratory to discover and develop a new compound. Next, basic safety questions are answered by nonclinical testing with animals and then, a drug or biotechnology company develops a prototype drug. That company must seek clearance from the FDA by way of an IND application to test the product with human subjects. 

Those tests, called clinical trials, are carried out sequentially in Phase I, II and III studies, which involve increasing numbers of subjects. The manufacturer then compiles the resulting data and analyses in an NDA. The FDA reviews the NDA with three major concerns: (1) safety and effectiveness in the drug's proposed use; (2) appropriateness of the proposed labeling; and (3) adequacy of manufacturing methods to assure the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity. 

The sponsor of the drug typically conducts human clinical trials in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase I clinical trials are generally conducted in a small number of healthy volunteers, primarily to collect and assess pharmacokinetics and safety data at one or more dosages prior to proceeding into patients. 

In Phase II clinical trials, the sponsor evaluates the early efficacy of the product in short-term trials on the targeted indication and identifies possible adverse effects and safety risks in a patient population. 

Phase III clinical trials typically involve testing for patients in long-term trials examining safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at geographically dispersed test sites. 

The FDA requires that clinical trials be conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s Good Clinical Practice (&#8220;GCP&#8221;) requirements. The FDA may order the partial, temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. Each clinical site that conducts a trial must obtain institutional review board ("IRB"), or ethics committee (outside of the U.S.), approval of the clinical trial design and patient-informed consent , and may also impose other conditions or require the clinical trial at that site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements. 

The results of the nonclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information on the manufacturing and composition of the product and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA for marketing approval. The NDA undergoes a 60-day validation review period before it is accepted for filing. 

The FDA and associated regulations detail the requirements at each step. The FDA uses a few special mechanisms to expedite drug development and the review process when a drug might address an unmet need or a serious disease or condition. Those mechanisms include accelerated approval, fast track and priority reviews, and the newer designation, breakthrough therapy. 

If the NDA is found to be incomplete, it will not be accepted. Once the NDA is validated and accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. 

Under policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA (currently PDUFA VII - effective September 30, 2022), the FDA has a target timeline of 10 months in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by two months to address deficiencies, or by three months if the FDA requests or if the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time during the review clock period. If the FDA&#8217;s evaluations of the NDA and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable and meet all regulations, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Priority review is reserved for drugs that represent a &#8220;significant improvement in safety or efficacy&#8221; over existing treatments. The FDA endeavors to complete priority reviews in six months. 

If the NDA meets with FDA approval, a letter will be sent out indicating approval and final labeling recommendations. If not, a complete response letter will be sent to applicants indicating that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. 

The complete response letter will describe the specific deficiencies that the agency has identified in an application and what changes must be made before the application can be approved, with no implication regarding whether the application will ultimately be approved. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug for the proposed indication(s) under study. While the FDA&#8217;s PDUFA 2021 Performance Report showed a continued increase in the percentage of first-cycle approval letters for new molecular entities rising from 56% for FY 2009 to 74% for FY 2024, we cannot be certain that timely first-cycle approvals will be maintained by the FDA. 

While the time and cost of completing these steps and obtaining FDA approval can vary dramatically depending on the drug, it can take many years and cost millions of dollars for a novel drug. 

Section 505(b) New Drug Applications 

An NDA may be submitted under different methods, a 505(b)(1), 505(b)(2) or 505(j). Section 505(b) provides for the submission of an NDA to support the approval of a drug. Upon approval, a drug may be marketed only for the FDA-approved indication(s) in the approved dosage form. Further clinical trials may be necessary to gain approval for the use of the product for any additional indications or dosage forms. 

The FDA also requires post-market safety surveillance reporting to monitor the side effects of the drug, which may result in withdrawal of approval after marketing begins if significant adverse safety findings are found. 

Section 505(b)(1), or the &#8216;full&#8217; NDA, is used for new chemical entities (&#8220;NCEs&#8221;) and requires full clinical and nonclinical development of a compound. Marketing exclusivity assigned to a 505(b)(1) approval is five years. A 505(b)(2) NDA permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant using previously reported safety and efficacy data, and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Generally new studies are required to provide data on the proposed change. 

Some examples of products that may be allowed to follow a 505(b)(2) path to approval are drugs that have a new dosage form, strength, route of administration, formulation or indication, or combination drugs. Marketing exclusivity for a 505(b)(2) submission is three years. 

Both 505 (b)(1) and (b)(2) are eligible for seven years of exclusivity for orphan drugs and/or six months for pediatric exclusivity. Any marketing exclusivity is independent of patent exclusivity. We successfully secured FDA approvals for Acetadote in January 2004 and for Caldolor in June 2009 pursuant to the 505(b)(2) pathway. 

Orphan drug designation 

The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 (the &#8220;Orphan Drug Act&#8221;) encourages manufacturers to seek approval of products intended to treat &#8220;rare diseases and conditions&#8221; with a prevalence of fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S. or for which there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the development costs for the product. For products that receive orphan drug designation by the FDA, the Orphan Drug Act provides tax credits for clinical research, FDA assistance with protocol design, eligibility for FDA grants to fund clinical studies, waiver of the FDA application fee and a period of seven years of marketing exclusivity for the product following FDA marketing approval. 

Acetadote received orphan drug designation in October 2001 and in 2004 the FDA approved the product to prevent or lessen hepatic injury after ingestion of a potentially hepatotoxic quantity of acetaminophen. Acetadote was entitled to marketing exclusivity until January 2011 for the treatment of this approved indication. We also received orphan drug designation for Ifetroban for the treatment of cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy in 2024. 

Rare pediatric disease designation and priority review vouchers (&#8220;PRV&#8221;) 

The rare pediatric disease PRV program aims to incentivize drug development for rare pediatric diseases. 

To be eligible for a voucher, the drug should be (1) approved for a rare pediatric disease and (2) treat or prevent a serious or life-threatening manifestation of the disease or condition that affects children. These serious or life-threatening manifestations may be the manifestations that primarily affect children, but they are not required to be, so long as the approved indication is clinically meaningful to pediatric patients with the disease or condition. 

Under this voucher program, a sponsor who receives an approval for a drug or biological product for a rare pediatric disease may qualify for a voucher that can be redeemed to receive priority review for a different product. The sponsor may also transfer or sell the voucher to another sponsor. 

FDA awards rare pediatric disease PRVs to sponsors of rare pediatric disease products that are approved and meet certain criteria. Prior to submitting a marketing application for its drug, a sponsor that plans to request a rare pediatric disease PRV may request rare pediatric disease designation. 

Section 505(j) abbreviated new drug applications 

An abbreviated new drug application (&#8220;ANDA&#8221;) is a type of NDA where approval of a generic drug is based on demonstrating comparability to an innovator drug product (the Reference Listed Drug, or RLD). Applications are "abbreviated" because they generally do not include pre-clinical and clinical data to establish safety and effectiveness. Generics must demonstrate that the product is bioequivalent (i.e., performs in the same manner and is comparable to the 'innovator' product in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics and intended use). 

Abbreviated applications may be submitted for drug products that are the same as a listed drug and must be identical in active ingredient(s), form, strength, route of administration and in conditions of use (non-exclusive uses). Products are declared suitable based on a suitability petition to the FDA. If the petition is approved, the sponsor may then submit the ANDA. 

The Hatch-Waxman Act 

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, informally known as the &#8220;Hatch-Waxman Act,&#8221; is a 1984 United States federal law that established the modern system of generic drugs. 

The Hatch-Waxman Act amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Section 505(j) 21 U.S.C. 355(j) sets forth the process by which would-be marketers of generic drugs can file ANDAs to seek FDA approval of the generic. Section 505(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV), the so-called Paragraph IV, allows 180-day exclusivity to companies that are the "first-to-file" an ANDA against holders of patents for branded counterparts. 

These Hatch-Waxman Act amendments grant generic manufacturers the ability to mount a validity challenge without incurring the cost of entry or risking enormous damages flowing from any possible infringement. The Hatch-Waxman Act essentially redistributes the relative risk assessments and explains the flow of settlement funds and their magnitude. The Hatch-Waxman Act gives generics considerable leverage in patent litigation. 

Health care legislation 

On March 23, 2010, former President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, (&#8220;PPACA&#8221;). On March 30, 2010, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (&#8220;HCERA&#8221;) was enacted into law, which modified the revenue provisions of the PPACA. The PPACA as amended by the HCERA constitutes the healthcare reform legislation. The following highlights certain provisions of the legislation that may affect us. 

Pharmaceutical Industry Fee: Beginning in calendar-year 2011, an annual fee was imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs (e.g., Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs programs, Department of Defense programs and TRICARE). 

The annual fee is allocated to companies based on their previous calendar-year market share using sales data that the government agencies that purchase the pharmaceuticals will provide to the Treasury Department. Although we participate in government programs that subject us to this fee, our sales volume in such programs is less than $10 million, with the first $5 million of sales being exempt from the fee. This fee has not had a material impact and is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations. 

In addition, PDUFA imposes annual program fees. An applicant will be assessed annual prescription drug program fees for prescription drug products, incurring a fee for each strength of a drug product. An applicant may not be assessed more than five prescription drug program fees for a fiscal year for prescription drug products identified in a single approved application. 

Under section 736(d)(1)(A) of the FD&#38;C Act, an applicant may qualify for a waiver of or reduction in application or program fees if the waiver or reduction is necessary to protect the public health. Under this provision, the FDA considers the following questions in determining whether to grant a public health waiver or reduction in user fees: (1) Does the product protect the public health? and (2) Is the waiver or reduction necessary to continue an activity that protects the public health? In addition, an applicant may qualify for a waiver or reduction in application or program fees when the assessment of the fees would present a significant barrier to innovation because of limited resources available to the applicant or other circumstances. 

Under section 736(a)(1)(F) of the FD&#38;C Act, a human drug application for a product that has been designated as a drug for a rare disease or condition (referred to as an orphan drug) under section 526 of the FD&#38;C Act is not subject to an application fee unless the human drug application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. 

Physician Payments Sunshine Act: The PPACA also includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (&#8220;Sunshine Act&#8221;), which requires manufacturers of pharmaceuticals and medical devices covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;), for aggregation and subsequent public disclosure. Under the Sunshine Act, beginning August 1, 2013, we have collected data regarding reportable transfers of value and have reported such data to CMS. Failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fines and/or penalties. In addition to the Federal Sunshine Act, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. 

Medicaid Rebate Rate: Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, we currently are required to provide rebates for covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. In addition, we also are required to participate in the Public Health Service&#8217;s 340B drug pricing program, which requires us to agree to charge no more than a designated ceiling price for covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. 

Product Serialization: In November of 2013, the FDA passed the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (&#8220;DSCSA&#8221;). The DSCSA was created to strengthen the security of the drug distribution supply chain by adding controls such as a national pharmaceutical track and trace system and establishing national standards for licensing of prescription drug wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers. DSCSA requires trading partners, including manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors and dispensers to provide transaction information to subsequent purchasers for certain prescription drugs. We have taken necessary steps to implement this program and are in compliance with all requirements. 

21 st Century Cures Act: The 21st Century Cures Act (&#8220;Cures Act&#8221;), signed into law on December 13, 2016, is designed to help accelerate medical product development and bring new innovations and advances to patients who need them faster and more efficiently. The law builds on the FDA&#8217;s ongoing work to incorporate the perspectives of patients into the development of drugs, biological products and devices in the FDA&#8217;s decision-making process. The Cures Act enhances the FDA&#8217;s ability to modernize clinical trial designs and clinical outcome assessments, which will speed the development and review of novel medical products, including medical countermeasures. 

Specifically, the Cures Act enables us to work with the FDA in the development of new biomarkers, clinical outcome assessments, surrogate endpoints and patient reported outcomes. It allows for the use of data summaries (rather than full clinical trials for approval) as well as the use of real-world evidence to support approval of new indications of approved medical products, or to help satisfy post-approval study requirements for marketed products. 

Post Approval Activities 

Once a drug is on the U.S. market (following FDA approval of the NDA), the FDA continues to address drug production, distribution and use. FDA activities are based on ensuring drug safety and effectiveness. They address product integrity, labeling, reporting of research and adverse events, surveillance, drug studies, risk management, information dissemination, off-label use, physician advertising and direct-to-consumer advertising. 

If we amend the NDA for an FDA-approved product, such as adding safety or efficacy labeling claims, promoting those new claims, making certain manufacturing changes or product enhancements, we will need FDA review and approval before the change can be implemented. While physicians may use products for indications that have not been approved by the FDA, we may not label or promote the product for an indication that has not been approved. 

Securing FDA approval for new indications, product enhancements and manufacturing and labeling changes may require us to conduct additional clinical trials under the FDA&#8217;s IND regulations. Even if such studies are conducted, they are still subject to the same requirements and timelines as an original NDA. 

The FDA continuously gathers information about possible adverse reactions to the products it has approved for use. The FDA requires all manufacturers to report adverse events. It also provides a procedure for consumers and physicians to voluntarily report their concerns about drugs. The agency collects those reports through MedWatch and uses its FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to store and analyze them. Because some events may occur after the use of a drug for reasons unrelated to the product, the FDA reviews the events to assess which ones may indicate a problem with that particular drug. 

They then use information gleaned from the surveillance data to determine a course of action. They might recommend a change in drug labeling to alert users to a potential problem, or perhaps, require the manufacturer to study the observed association between the drug and the adverse event. 

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. 

The federal health care program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed health care programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and prescribers, purchasers or formulary managers. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. 

In addition to these U.S. laws, we are subject to similar laws that govern our marketing practices and financial arrangements with health care providers and otherwise are intended to prohibit illicit kickbacks and bribery, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 

Federal False Claims Act 

The federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. 

A number of pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. 

HIPAA and Other Data Protection Laws 

In the United States, we and our collaborators are subject to numerous federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. These laws include obligations related to protecting the privacy and security of health-related personal information, such as information that we may obtain through the clinical trial process. In addition, similar laws and regulations exist in Europe and other jurisdictions, including the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation. 

ICH - International Committee on Harmonization 

Outside of the U.S., our ability to market our products will depend on receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The International Committee on Harmonization (&#8220;ICH&#8221;) provides a set of standards that most regulatory authorities adhere to (e.g. U.S., Europe and Japan) allowing greater harmonization in the interpretation and application of technical guidelines and requirements for pharmaceutical product registration, thereby reducing or obviating duplication of testing carried out during the research and development of new human medicines. Regulatory harmonization offers many direct benefits to both regulatory authorities and the pharmaceutical industry with beneficial impact for the protection of public health. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and we believe that our operations comply with such regulations. We anticipate that the effects of compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment will not have any material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 

SEASONALITY 

There are no significant seasonal aspects to our business. 

BACKLOG 

Due to the relatively short lead-time required to fill orders for our products, backlog of orders is not considered material to our business. 

EMPLOYEES 

As of December 31, 2024 we had 91 employees. We believe that our future will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel, including hospital oncology and field sales personnel in particular. To that end, we work with qualified search firms to identify talent, we measure and adjust compensation levels to remain competitive and we work closely with team members to support their success. 

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

We make statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are &#8220;forward-looking statements&#8221; within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
