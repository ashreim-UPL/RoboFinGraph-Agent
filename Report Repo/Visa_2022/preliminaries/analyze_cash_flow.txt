In fiscal 2022, Visa generated $18.8 billion from operating activities, reflecting strong core business profitability driven by increased payments volume and transaction growth. Investing cash flows used $4.3 billion, primarily due to higher acquisitions and lower investment securities proceeds, indicating ongoing capital investments. Financing activities consumed $12.7 billion, mainly from substantial share repurchases ($11.6 billion) and dividend payments ($3.2 billion), partially offset by debt issuance. Compared to prior years, operating cash flow improved significantly, supporting liquidity and strategic investments, though high capital returns and debt repayments suggest a focus on shareholder value and debt management. Overall, Visa demonstrates robust cash management, maintaining ample liquidity ($15.7 billion cash and $4.5 billion investments), positioning it well for future growth, though substantial share repurchases and debt obligations warrant ongoing liquidity monitoring.
