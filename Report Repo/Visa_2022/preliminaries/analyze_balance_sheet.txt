Analyzing Visa's most recent balance sheet (FY2024), total assets stand at $94.5 billion, with current assets of $34 billion and total liabilities of $55.4 billion, indicating a solid liquidity position as current assets ($34B) comfortably cover current liabilities ($26.5B). Long-term debt is substantial at $20.8 billion, but the company's equity of $39.1 billion remains robust, reflecting a stable capital base. Compared to FY2023 and FY2022, assets and equity have grown modestly, while liabilities have increased, suggesting prudent leverage management. The low short-term debt and high cash reserves ($15.7B) support liquidity, but elevated long-term debt warrants monitoring. Overall, Visa demonstrates strong asset management, manageable leverage, and a resilient capital structure, positioning it favorably for sustained operational stability and future growth.
