**Revenue Growth and Sources:** Visa reported $29.31 billion in net revenues for FY2024, a 22% increase YoY from $24.11 billion in FY2023, driven primarily by a 15% rise in total payments volume (from $5.36T to $6.18T) and processed transactions up 17% (from 164.7M to 192.5M). Service and data processing revenues contributed significantly, with service revenues up 16% and data processing revenues increasing 13%, reflecting robust transaction activity. International revenues surged 27%, notably from cross-border volume growth, indicating strong global expansion.

**Cost Control and Margins:** Cost of revenue rose to $7.04 billion (from $6.57 billion), a 7% increase, outpacing revenue growth slightly, which compressed gross profit margins to approximately 28.8 billion (from 26.09 billion), a margin of ~98%. Operating expenses increased 26% to $10.5 billion, mainly due to litigation provisions and personnel costs, impacting operating margins. Net income of $19.74 billion grew 60% YoY, with net profit margins at approximately 67%, showcasing high operational efficiency despite rising costs.

**Profitability and EPS:** The company’s EPS improved to $9.74 (diluted $9.73), a 24% increase from $7.00 ($7.00 diluted) in FY2023, reflecting strong earnings growth and effective capital management. The substantial net income and EPS growth highlight Visa’s resilient profitability and positive investor outlook amid expanding transaction volumes.

**Strategic Outlook:** Visa’s revenue and profit metrics demonstrate robust growth driven by increased global payments activity, with margins remaining high despite rising operating expenses. The company’s focus on international expansion and transaction processing efficiency positions it favorably against industry peers, though cost management and litigation provisions remain areas to monitor for sustained profitability.
