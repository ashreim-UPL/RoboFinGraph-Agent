Visa's valuation reflects its strong revenue growth, driven by increased global transaction volumes and cross-border activity, resulting in FY2024 net revenues of 29.31 billion dollars, up 22% YoY. Profitability remains high, with net income of 19.74 billion dollars and net profit margins around 67%, supported by efficient cost control despite rising operating expenses. The company's balance sheet shows total assets of 94.5 billion dollars, with solid liquidity indicated by current assets of 34 billion dollars covering current liabilities of 26.5 billion dollars. Equity stands at 39.1 billion dollars, and cash reserves of 15.7 billion dollars bolster liquidity. Although long-term debt is notable at 20.8 billion dollars, Visa's manageable leverage and consistent asset growth suggest a stable financial position, supporting continued valuation growth amid expanding global payments activity.
