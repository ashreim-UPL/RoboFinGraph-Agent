The company's net cash flow for FY 2024 shows a modest inflow of ₹54.56 crore, reversing a prior outflow of ₹5.88 crore, indicating improved liquidity. Operating cash flow increased significantly to ₹3300.50 crore from ₹2755.47 crore, reflecting strong core business profitability. Investing activities remained negative at ₹2379.18 crore, primarily due to substantial capital expenditures of ₹2162.32 crore, though these decreased from the previous year's ₹3291.24 crore, suggesting a focus on strategic growth. Financing activities also remained negative at ₹868.22 crore, driven by debt repayments and dividend payments, with debt issuance nearly stable. Overall, the company demonstrates effective cash management, maintaining liquidity while investing in growth, though continued high capital expenditure and dividend payouts pose potential liquidity risks if operating cash flows falter.
