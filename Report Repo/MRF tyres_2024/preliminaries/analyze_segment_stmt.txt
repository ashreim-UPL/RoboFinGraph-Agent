**Automotive & Vehicle Tyres Segment**  
This segment, including passenger vehicles, two-wheelers, and commercial vehicles, contributed significantly to revenue growth, with total income reaching Rs. 24,986 crores in 2023-24, up from Rs. 22,826 crores in 2022-23. The segment experienced a 17% increase in motorcycle and scooter production, driven by new product launches like ‘Steel Brace’ radial tyres, and a 12.5% rise in domestic vehicle sales (source: MD&A). Market share remains strong, with continued preference for SUVs and higher capacity bikes, supported by strategic OEM partnerships. Profitability improved markedly, with operating profit margin rising to 11.12% from 4.82%, and net profit increasing to Rs. 2081 crores from Rs. 769 crores, reflecting operational efficiencies and product innovation. Challenges include muted growth in commercial vehicles and the impact of geopolitical tensions on exports, but innovations and strategic OEM collaborations have bolstered market position and revenue growth, supported by increased product offerings and a focus on electric vehicle adaptation.

**Rubber & Raw Material Inputs Segment**  
The segment faced rising raw material costs, notably natural rubber, impacted by climate variability and geopolitical tensions, which constrained margins despite a 13% growth in OTR tyre production. The company’s strategic focus on cost management and raw material procurement helped maintain profitability, with raw material prices decreasing in the second half, aiding margin expansion. The segment’s revenue growth was supported by new farm radial tyres launched at Agritechnica, Germany, and increased exports to resilient markets like Far East and Africa (source: MD&A). The company’s emphasis on product innovation, including farm radial tyres, and market expansion efforts have strengthened its competitive position. However, raw material volatility and geopolitical risks remain significant, potentially affecting future margins. Overall, the segment’s revenue growth and profit margins are sustained through operational efficiencies, new product launches, and strategic market focus, despite external cost pressures.

**Export & International Market Segment**  
Exports totaled Rs. 1874 crores in 2023-24, marginally higher than Rs. 1866 crores in 2022-23, despite challenges like regulatory restrictions and shipping disruptions from geopolitical tensions (source: MD&A). The company maintained volume and revenue in key markets such as Far East and Africa through resilient demand and product diversification, including farm radial tyres. Strategic partnerships with global distributors and participation in international trade shows like Agritechnica have enhanced market penetration. Export growth was hampered by increased ocean freight costs and forex shortages, but product innovation and targeted market strategies helped sustain revenue. The company’s focus on expanding in emerging markets and launching new farm radial tyres has supported its global market position. External risks from geopolitical tensions and fluctuating raw material costs continue to challenge profitability, but strategic partnerships and product diversification have mitigated some adverse effects, ensuring steady export revenue.

**Product Innovation & Strategic Partnerships**  
The company launched ‘Steel Brace’ high-performance radial tyres for motorcycles and introduced farm radial tyres at Agritechnica, Germany, boosting income and market share (source: MD&A). Strategic OEM partnerships, with many OEMs increasing fitments of the company’s tyres, have strengthened market position and supported revenue growth. Collaborations with global distributors and participation in international trade shows have expanded market reach, especially in farm and off-the-road segments. These innovations and alliances have enhanced product offerings, improved margins, and reinforced the company’s leadership in key segments, contributing to a 17% growth in motorcycle and scooter production and supporting overall income growth.

**Market Position & Competitive Dynamics**  
The company maintains a dominant market position in India’s tyre industry, with a focus on passenger vehicles, two-wheelers, and farm equipment, supported by new product launches and OEM collaborations. The domestic market saw record sales, with SUVs comprising over 50% of passenger vehicle sales, and a 7% growth in passenger vehicle production (source: MD&A). Export markets remain competitive, with resilience in Far East and Africa, despite geopolitical and regulatory challenges. The company’s strategic focus on innovation, product diversification, and strengthening OEM relationships has sustained its market share and competitive edge. External factors like geopolitical tensions and policy shifts, such as subsidy reductions on electric vehicles, pose challenges but are countered by product innovation and market expansion strategies, ensuring the company’s continued leadership and growth.

**Cost & Operational Expenses Analysis**  
Operational costs increased due to raw material price volatility, inflationary pressures, and channel expansion expenses, but strategic cost management and raw material procurement helped contain margins. Expenses on product innovation, including new tyre launches, and investments in OEM partnerships and market expansion contributed to increased operational expenditure. The company’s focus on cost efficiencies, such as reducing dependence on volatile raw materials and optimizing supply chains, has supported profit margins. Despite external cost pressures, the company’s operational expenses are balanced by revenue growth from product innovation, new market entries, and strategic collaborations, ensuring sustained profitability and competitive positioning.
