In FY 2023, the company generated $73.5 million in operating cash flow, driven by net income adjustments and favorable working capital changes, indicating improved core business cash profitability. Investing activities used $12.1 million, primarily for property, software development, and software investments, reflecting ongoing capital expenditure to support growth. Financing activities consumed $11.5 million, mainly due to stock repurchases and tax payments related to equity awards, with some inflows from stock option exercises. Compared to prior periods, operating cash flow shifted from negative in 2022 to positive in 2023, signaling enhanced liquidity and operational efficiency. Overall, the company's cash management appears effective, bolstered by sufficient cash reserves and investments, positioning it for continued growth, though ongoing investments and share repurchases suggest careful liquidity monitoring is essential to mitigate future financial risks.
