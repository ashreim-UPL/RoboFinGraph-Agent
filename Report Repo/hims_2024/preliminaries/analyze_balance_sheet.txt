Hims & Hers' most recent balance sheet as of FY 2023 shows total assets of $707.5 million, with current assets at $395.8 million adequately covering current liabilities of $221.4 million, indicating strong liquidity. The company's net debt position is highly favorable at -$209.2 million, reflecting substantial net cash after debt offset, and long-term debt is minimal at $9.5 million. Shareholders' equity stands robust at $476.7 million, with a significant retained earnings deficit of -$242.1 million, but overall equity remains healthy for long-term investment. Compared to prior years, assets and equity have grown, and liquidity has improved markedly, while leverage remains low. This suggests a solid capital structure, effective asset management, and low financial risk, positioning the firm well for sustained growth and operational stability.
