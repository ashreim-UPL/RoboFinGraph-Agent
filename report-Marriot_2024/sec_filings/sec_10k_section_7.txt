 Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for year-end 2023 compared to year-end 2022 can be found in Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on February 13, 2024 (&#8220;2023 Form 10-K&#8221;). 

BUSINESS AND OVERVIEW 

Overview 

We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotel, residential, timeshare, and other lodging properties under more than 30 brand names. We discuss our operations in the following reportable business segments: (1) U.S. &#38; Canada, (2) Europe, Middle East &#38; Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;), (3) Greater China, and (4) Asia Pacific excluding China (&#8220;APEC&#8221;). Our Caribbean &#38; Latin America (&#8220;CALA&#8221;) operating segment does not meet the applicable accounting criteria for separate disclosure as a reportable business segment, and as such, we include its results in &#8220;Unallocated corporate and other.&#8221; 

Under our asset-light business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels and other lodging offerings, rather than own them. Terms of our management agreements vary, but we earn a management fee that is typically composed of a base management fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel, and an incentive management fee, which is based on the profits of the hotel. In many cases (particularly in our U.S. &#38; Canada, Europe, and CALA regions), incentive management fees are subject to a specified owner return. Under our hotel franchising arrangements, we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees, which are typically based on a percentage of room revenues, plus for certain brands, a percentage 

&#160; &#160; 

of food and beverage revenues. We also have license and other agreements with third parties for certain offerings, such as for our timeshare properties, MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy, Design Hotels, and The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection, under which we receive royalty fees and certain other fees. Additionally, we earn fees for other uses of our intellectual property, including primarily co-branded credit card fees, as well as residential branding fees and certain other licensing fees. 

Performance Measures 

We believe Revenue per Available Room (&#8220;RevPAR&#8221;), which we calculate by dividing property level room revenue by total rooms available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues. RevPAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues, and should not be viewed as necessarily correlating with our fee revenue. We also believe occupancy and average daily rate (&#8220;ADR&#8221;), which are components of calculating RevPAR, are meaningful indicators of our performance. Occupancy, which we calculate by dividing total rooms sold by total rooms available for the period, measures the utilization of a property&#8217;s available capacity. ADR, which we calculate by dividing property level room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels. RevPAR, occupancy, and ADR statistics are on a systemwide basis for comparable properties, unless otherwise stated. Unless otherwise stated, all changes refer to year-over-year changes for the comparable period. Comparisons to prior periods are on a constant U.S. dollar basis, which we calculate by applying exchange rates for the current period to the prior comparable period. We believe constant dollar analysis provides valuable information regarding the performance of hotels in our system as it removes currency fluctuations from the presentation of such results. 

We define our comparable properties as hotels in our system that were open and operating under one of our brands since the beginning of the last full calendar year (since January 1, 2023 for the current period) and have not, in either the current or previous year: (1) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (2) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (3) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. Our comparable properties also exclude MGM Collection with Marriott Bonvoy, Design Hotels, The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection, and timeshare properties. For 2024, we had 5,439 comparable U.S. &#38; Canada properties and 1,741 comparable International properties. 

Business Trends 

We saw solid global RevPAR growth during 2024 compared to 2023. In 2024, worldwide RevPAR increased 4.3 percent compared to 2023, reflecting ADR growth of 2.8 percent and occupancy improvement of 1.0 percentage point. The increase in RevPAR was driven by strong year-over-year demand growth in nearly all our regions. 

In the U.S. &#38; Canada, where demand has normalized, RevPAR increased 3.0 percent in 2024, led by strong demand from group as well as strong demand from transient customer segments across our brand tiers. 

In EMEA, RevPAR growth of 9.1 percent in 2024 was driven by strong demand in most countries across the region, aided by the 2024 Paris Olympics and other special events. In APEC, RevPAR increased 12.9 percent in 2024, driven by strong demand, including an increase in inbound demand into the region. In CALA, RevPAR increased 8.8 percent in 2024, driven by strong demand throughout the region. In Greater China, RevPAR declined 2.3 percent in 2024 due to lower domestic demand as a result of macro-economic conditions and an increase in outbound travel. 

In 2024, we launched a comprehensive initiative to enhance our effectiveness and efficiency across the Company. At this point in the process, we expect this initiative to yield $80 million to $90 million of annual general and administrative cost reductions beginning in 2025. These efforts are also anticipated to deliver cost savings to our hotel owners. 

As part of these efforts, in the second half of 2024, we implemented a voluntary retirement program for certain above-property associates, and some above-property roles in the organization were eliminated or redefined. We substantially completed this initiative as of year-end 2024. 

Starwood Data Security Incident 

On November 30, 2018, we announced a data security incident involving unauthorized access to the Starwood reservations database (the &#8220;Data Security Incident&#8221;). We are currently unable to reasonably estimate the range of total possible financial impact to the Company from the Data Security Incident in excess of the expenses already recorded; however, we do not believe this incident will impact our long-term financial health. See Note 7 for additional information related to legal proceedings and governmental investigations related to the Data Security Incident. 

&#160; &#160; 

System Growth and Pipeline 

Our system grew from 8,785 properties (1,597,380 rooms) at year-end 2023 to 9,361 properties (1,706,331 rooms) at year-end 2024. The increase compared to year-end 2023 reflected gross additions of 666 properties (123,389 rooms), including the addition of 16 properties (approximately 38,000 rooms) from our exclusive, long-term strategic licensing agreement with MGM Resorts International and 163 properties (approximately 9,000 rooms) from our long-term agreement with Sonder Holdings Inc., and deletions of 90 properties (14,572 rooms). Our 2024 gross room additions included approximately 52,300 rooms located outside U.S. &#38; Canada and roughly 75,300 rooms converted from competitor brands. 

At year-end 2024, we had nearly 3,800 properties and over 577,000 rooms in our development pipeline, which includes roughly 29,000 rooms approved for development but not yet under signed contracts. Our development pipeline includes over 229,000 rooms, or 40 percent, that were under construction or in the process of converting to our system at year-end 2024. Fifty-five percent of the rooms in our development pipeline are located outside U.S. &#38; Canada. 

In 2024, we signed over 1,200 development deals with hotel owners and other counterparties for nearly 162,000 rooms globally. Approximately 34 percent of rooms signed were the result of conversion opportunities. During 2024, we continued to strengthen our luxury portfolio and grow our midscale brands. In December 2024, we also announced the expansion of our outdoor-focused lodging offerings. 

In 2025, we expect net rooms growth of 4 to 5 percent.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 

The discussion below presents an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for 2024 compared to 2023. Also see the &#8220;Business Trends&#8221; section above for further discussion. 

Fee Revenues 

##TABLE_START 

($ in millions) 

2024 2023 Change 2024 vs. 2023 Base management fees $ 1,288 $ 1,238 $ 50 4 % Franchise fees 3,113 2,831 282 10 % Incentive management fees 769 755 14 2 % Gross fee revenues 5,170 4,824 346 7 % Contract investment amortization (103) (88) (15) (17) % Net fee revenues $ 5,067 $ 4,736 $ 331 7 % ##TABLE_END

The increase in base management fees primarily reflected higher RevPAR and unit growth ($26 million). 

The increase in franchise fees primarily reflected higher RevPAR, unit growth ($99 million), higher co-branded credit card fees ($59 million), higher residential branding fees ($36 million), and higher fees from properties that converted from managed to franchised ($31 million). 

The increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher profits at managed hotels. In 2024, we earned incentive management fees from 69 percent of our managed hotels worldwide, compared to 68 percent in 2023. We earned incentive management fees from 31 percent of our U.S. &#38; Canada managed hotels and 85 percent of our International managed hotels in each of 2024 and 2023. In addition, 67 percent of our total incentive management fees in 2024 came from our International managed hotels, primarily in EMEA and APEC, versus 65 percent in 2023. 

&#160; &#160; 

Owned, Leased, and Other 

##TABLE_START 

($ in millions) 

2024 2023 Change 2024 vs. 2023 Owned, leased, and other revenue $ 1,551 $ 1,564 $ (13) (1) % Owned, leased, and other - direct expenses 1,200 1,165 35 3 % Owned, leased, and other, net $ 351 $ 399 $ (48) (12) % ##TABLE_END

Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, decreased primarily due to $65 million of higher termination fees recorded in the prior year, largely related to one development project in U.S. &#38; Canada. 

Cost Reimbursements 

##TABLE_START 

($ in millions) 

2024 2023 Change 2024 vs. 2023 Cost reimbursement revenue $ 18,482 $ 17,413 $ 1,069 6 % Reimbursed expenses 18,799 17,424 1,375 8 % Cost reimbursements, net $ (317) $ (11) $ (306) (2,782) % ##TABLE_END

Cost reimbursements, net (cost reimbursement revenue, net of reimbursed expenses) varies due to timing differences between the costs we incur for centralized programs and services and the related rei mbursemen ts we receive from hotel owners and certain other counterparties. Over the long term, our centralized programs and services are not designed to impact our economics, either positively or negatively. See Note 2 for more information about the accounting for cost reimbursements, including our Loyalty Program. 

The decrease in cost reimbursements, net primarily reflected lower revenues, net of expenses, for many of our programs and services, and Loyalty Program activity, which incurred higher program expenses. 

Other Operating Expenses 

##TABLE_START 

($ in millions) 

2024 2023 Change 2024 vs. 2023 Depreciation, amortization, and other $ 183 $ 189 $ (6) (3) % General, administrative, and other 1,074 1,011 63 6 % Restructuring and merger-related charges 77 60 17 28 % ##TABLE_END

General, administrative, and other expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation costs ($53 million) and higher guarantee reserves ($22 million). 

Restructuring and merger-related charges increased primarily due to $37 million of restructuring charges for employee termination benefits discussed in Note 16 and a $30 million reserve for a loan commitment related to the Company&#8217;s acquisition of Starwood, partially offset by $35 million of lower charges related to the Data Security Incident discussed in Note 7.

Gains and other income, net decreased primarily due to a gain recorded in the prior year on the sale of a hotel in the CALA region ($24 million). 

Interest expense increased primarily due to higher debt balances driven by Senior Notes issuances, net of maturities ($125 million). 

&#160; &#160;

2024 2023 Change 2024 vs. 2023 

Provision for income taxes 

$ (776) $ (295) $ (481) (163) % ##TABLE_END

Our tax provision increased in 2024 primarily due to intellectual property restructuring transactions resulting in non-U.S. tax benefits in the prior year ($228 million), the prior year release of a tax valuation allowance as the Company concluded it is more likely than not to recognize non-U.S. tax benefits ($223 million), and the prior year release of tax reserves, which was mostly due to the completion of a prior year tax audit ($103 million). The increase was partially offset by a decrease in pre-tax income ($51 million).

In 2024, net fee revenues grew in U.S. &#38; Canada, EMEA, and APEC compared to 2023, primarily driven by higher RevPAR and unit growth (see the Lodging Statistics and Properties and Rooms tables above for more information), as well as higher profits at managed hotels. In Greater China, net fee revenues decreased in 2024 primarily due to lower RevPAR. 

U.S. &#38; Canada segment profit decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 despite the higher net fee revenues due to $138 million of lower cost reimbursement revenue, net of reimbursed expenses, $59 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $28 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses. Owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses decreased primarily due to higher termination fees in the prior year, largely related to one development project. General, administrative, and other expenses increased primarily due to higher guarantee reserves. 

EMEA segment profit increased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to higher net fee revenues and $30 million of lower general, administrative, and other expenses, primarily due to lower litigation accruals, partially offset by $26 million of lower cost reimbursement revenue, net of reimbursed expenses. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Our Credit Facility 

We are party to a $4.5 billion multicurrency revolving credit agreement (as amended, the &#8220;Credit Facility&#8221;). Available borrowings under the Credit Facility support our commercial paper program and general corporate needs. U.S. dollar borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at SOFR (the Secured Overnight Financing Rate) plus a spread based on our 

&#160; &#160; 

public debt rating. We also pay quarterly fees on the Credit Facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. We classify outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and outstanding commercial paper borrowings (which generally have short-term maturities of 45 days or less) as long-term based on our ability and intent to refinance the outstanding borrowings on a long-term basis. The Credit Facility expires on December 14, 2027. 

The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of Adjusted Total Debt to EBITDA, each as defined in the Credit Facility) to not more than 4.5 to 1.0. Our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. We currently satisfy the covenants in our Credit Facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the Credit Facility, and do not expect the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and liquidity needs. 

We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to fund our liquidity needs. We believe the Credit Facility, and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, remain adequate to meet our liquidity requirements. 

Commercial Paper 

We issue commercial paper in the U.S. Because we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. We do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and access to capital markets. 

Cash from Operations 

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $421 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2024 reflected a cash outflow of $300 million in the &#8220;Restructuring and merger-related charges&#8221; caption of our Statements of Cash Flows for the settlement of the guarantee liability associated with the purchase of the Sheraton Grand Chicago (discussed in Note 3). Cash flows for 2023 reflected reduced cash received from U.S. co-branded credit card issuers related to the 2020 prepayment of certain future revenues. Such reductions ended as of year-end 2023. 

Our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.4 to 1.0 at both year-end 2024 and year-end 2023. We have significant borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility should we need additional working capital. 

Investing Activities Cash Flows 

Capital Expenditures and Other Investments. We made capital and technology expenditures of $750 million in 2024 and $452 million in 2023. Capital and technology expenditures in 2024 increased by $298 million compared to 2023, primarily due to approximately $200 million of spending related to the Sheraton Grand Chicago capitalized assets (discussed in Note 3) and higher than typical spending on our worldwide technology systems transformation, the overwhelming portion of which is expected to be reimbursed over time. In 2023, we also had cash outflows of $101 million due to the City Express brand acquisition. 

We expect capital expenditures and other investments will total approximately $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion for 2025, including capital and technology expenditures, loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and other investing activities, but excluding any potential property or brand acquisitions, which we cannot forecast with sufficient accuracy and which may be significant. Our anticipated capital and technology expenditures include higher than typical spending on our worldwide technology systems transformation and renovations of hotels in our owned and leased portfolio. 

Dispositions. Property and asset sales generated $16 million of cash proceeds in 2024 and $71 million in 2023. 

Over time, we have sold lodging properties, both completed and under development, generally subject to long-term management agreements. Our ability to attract third-party purchasers, and their ability to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties, depends in part on the perceived risks in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets. We monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations. We have made, and expect to continue making, selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business, which may include property acquisitions and renovations, new construction, loans, guarantees, and equity investments. Over time, we seek to minimize capital invested in our business through asset sales subject to long-term management or franchise agreements. 

&#160; &#160; 

Financing Activities Cash Flows 

Debt. Debt increased by $2,574 million in 2024, to $14,447 million at year-end 2024 from $11,873 million at year-end 2023, primarily due to the issuances of our Series PP Notes and Series QQ Notes ($1,480 million) and Series NN Notes and Series OO Notes ($1,468 million), partially offset by the maturity of our Series CC Notes ($550 million). See Note 9 for additional information on Senior Notes issuances. 

Our long-term financial objectives include maintaining diversified financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, and reducing our working capital. At year-end 2024, our long-term debt had a weighted average interest rate of 4.5 percent and a weighted average maturity of approximately 5.0 years. The ratio of our fixed-rate long-term debt to our total long-term debt was 0.9 to 1.0 at year-end 2024. 

See the &#8220;Our Credit Facility&#8221; caption in this &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; section for more information on our Credit Facility. 

Share Repurchases and Dividends. We repurchased 15.4 million shares of our common stock for $3.7 billion in 2024. Year-to-date through February 7, 2025, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for $350 million. For additional information, see &#8220;Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities&#8221; in Part II, Item 5. 

Our Board declared the following quarterly cash dividends in 2024: (1) $0.52 per share declared on February 8, 2024 and paid on March 29, 2024 to stockholders of record on February 22, 2024; (2) $0.63 per share declared on May 10, 2024 and paid on June 28, 2024 to stockholders of record on May 24, 2024; (3) $0.63 per share declared on August 2, 2024 and paid on September 30, 2024 to stockholders of record on August 16, 2024; and (4) $0.63 per share declared on November 7, 2024 and paid on December 31, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 21, 2024. 

We expect to continue to return cash to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and cash dividends. 

Material Cash Requirements 

Our material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements. 

&#8226; At year-end 2024, we had $14,447 million of debt plus $3,110 million of future interest payments, of which a total of $1,866 million is payable within the next 12 months from year-end 2024. See Note 9 for further information about our long-term debt and Note 8 for further information about our finance leases. 

&#8226; We enter into operating leases primarily for hotels, offices, and equipment, which are discussed in Note 8. 

&#8226; At December 31, 2024, projected Deemed Repatriation Transition Tax payments under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act totaled $135 million, which is payable within the next 12 months from year-end 2024. 

&#8226; The Company had guarantees and letters of credit as of year-end 2024, which are discussed in Note 7. The majority of our remaining guarantee commitments are not expected to be funded within the next 12 months from year-end 2024. 

&#8226; In the normal course of business, we enter into purchase commitments related to the programs and services that we typically provide to hotel owners, and we incur other obligations to manage the daily operating needs of the hotels that we manage. Since our contracts with hotel owners generally require reimbursement for expenses incurred in providing these programs and services and managing the daily operating needs of the hotels that we manage, these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on our net income and cash flow over the long term. 

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

We do not expect that accounting standards updates issued to date and that are effective after December 31, 2024 will have a material effect on our Financial Statements. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

Our preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Management considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain when the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition. 

&#160; &#160; 

While we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available when the estimate or assumption was made. Actual results may differ significantly. Additionally, changes in our assumptions, estimates or assessments due to unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 

See Note 2 for further information related to our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are as follows: 

Loyalty Program , including how we estimate the breakage of hotel points, credit card points, and free night certificates, the volume of points and free night certificates that will be issued under our co-branded credit card agreements, the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled under our co-branded credit card agreements, and the stand-alone selling prices of goods and services provided under our co-branded credit card agreements. Changes in these estimates could result in material changes to our liability for guest loyalty program and Loyalty Program revenue. Based on the conditions existing at December 31, 2024 and holding other factors constant, a one percent decrease in our estimate of the breakage of points could result in an increase in the liability for guest loyalty program of approximately $50 million. The breakage impact may vary significantly depending on the specific Loyalty Program points for which the anticipated breakage changes. 

Goodwill , including how we evaluate the fair value of reporting units and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill. Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. See Note 14 for more information. During the 2024 fourth quarter, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test, and no impairment charges were recorded. The estimated fair values of all our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying amounts at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination. 

Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets , including how we evaluate the fair value of intangibles and long-lived assets and when we record impairment losses on intangibles and long-lived assets. During 2024, we evaluated our intangibles and long-lived asset groups for impairment and did not record any material impairment charges. The estimated fair values of all our indefinite-lived intangible assets significantly exceeded their carrying amounts at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination.
