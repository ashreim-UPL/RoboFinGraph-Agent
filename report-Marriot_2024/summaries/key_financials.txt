Marriott International’s 2024 financial overview shows a blend of encouraging revenue growth alongside challenges in cost control and liquidity. The company experienced higher total revenues, bolstered by fee income increases, yet rising operating and tax expenses hindered operating and net profit margins. Despite stable earnings per share and significant share repurchases, profitability was subdued by escalating costs. The balance sheet reflected a heavily leveraged capital structure with increased long-term debt and a marked decline in shareholders’ equity, while current assets fell short of current liabilities, underscoring short-term liquidity issues. Additionally, operating cash flows softened amid substantial investments and financing outflows. This financial profile suggests an imperative for improved cost management and more disciplined debt and asset oversight to sustain future growth and stability.
