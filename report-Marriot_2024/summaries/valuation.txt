Marriott’s valuation presents a mixed picture, combining resilient revenue growth with significant financial challenges. The company achieved a revenue increase to $25.1 billion in 2024, buoyed by strong fee income and RevPAR improvements. However, rising operating costs, increased interest expenses, and a higher tax burden have compressed margins, with operating income declining and net income falling by 23%. At the same time, the balance sheet reveals heightened financial leverage, with long-term debt and total debt growing and shareholders’ equity worsening sharply into negative territory. Limited current liquidity and an increased debt burden signal potential solvency concerns. Overall, while Marriott continues to generate robust revenue streams, strategic focus on operational efficiency and asset management will be essential to sustain shareholder value and improve its leveraged financial structure.
