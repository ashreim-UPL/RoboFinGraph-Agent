Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 of the Company&#8217;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. \n\nFiscal Period \n\nThe Company&#8217;s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company&#8217;s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company&#8217;s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. \n\nFiscal Year Highlights \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nThe Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: \n\nFirst Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPad and iPad Pro; \n\n&#8226; Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \n\n&#8226; MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service. \n\nSecond Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Pro 14&#8221;, MacBook Pro 16&#8221; and Mac mini; and \n\n&#8226; Second-generation HomePod. \n\nThird Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; MacBook Air 15&#8221;, Mac Studio and Mac Pro; \n\n&#8226; Apple Vision Pro&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s first spatial computer featuring its new visionOS&#8482;, expected to be available in early calendar year 2024; and \n\n&#8226; iOS 17, macOS Sonoma, iPadOS 17, tvOS 17 and watchOS 10, updates to the Company&#8217;s operating systems. \n\nFourth Quarter 2023: \n\n&#8226; iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \n\n&#8226; Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. \n\nIn May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. \n\nMacroeconomic Conditions \n\nMacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 20 \n\nSegment Operating Performance \n\nThe following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Net sales by reportable segment: Americas $ 162,560 (4) % $ 169,658 11 % $ 153,306 Europe 94,294 (1) % 95,118 7 % 89,307 Greater China 72,559 (2) % 74,200 9 % 68,366 Japan 24,257 (7) % 25,977 (9) % 28,482 Rest of Asia Pacific 29,615 1 % 29,375 11 % 26,356 Total net sales $ 383,285 (3) % $ 394,328 8 % $ 365,817 ##TABLE_END\n\nAmericas \n\nAmericas net sales decreased 4% or $7.1 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of iPhone and Mac, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. \n\nEurope \n\nEurope net sales decreased 1% or $824 million during 2023 compared to 2022.

As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. \n\nOperating Expenses \n\nOperating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % ##TABLE_END\n\nResearch and Development \n\nThe year-over-year growth in R&#38;D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. \n\nSelling, General and Administrative \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 \n\nProvision for Income Taxes \n\nProvision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): \n\n##TABLE_START 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % ##TABLE_END\n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&#38;D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. \n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources \n\nThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. \n\nThe Company&#8217;s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: \n\nDebt \n\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months.

Note 1, &#8220;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. \n\nUncertain Tax Positions \n\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company&#8217;s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company&#8217;s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company&#8217;s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nLegal and Other Contingencies \n\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management&#8217;s expectations could have a material impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and operating results. \n\nApple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25 \n\n\n\nInstruction: \nConduct a comprehensive analysis of the company\'s income statement for the current fiscal year. \nStart with an overall revenue record, including Year-over-Year or Quarter-over-Quarter comparisons, and break down revenue sources to identify primary contributors and trends. \nExamine the Cost of Goods Sold for potential cost control issues. \nReview profit margins such as gross, operating, and net profit margins to evaluate cost efficiency, operational effectiveness, and overall profitability. \nAnalyze Earnings Per Share to understand investor perspectives. \nCompare these metrics with historical data and industry or competitor benchmarks to identify growth patterns, profitability trends, and operational challenges. \nThe output should be a strategic overview of the company’s financial health in a single paragraph, less than 130 words, summarizing the previous analysis into 4-5 key points under respective subheadings with specific discussion and strong data support.', 'role': 'assistant', 'name': 'User_Proxy'}, {'content': 'Revenue Performance: Apple achieved $391 billion in FY2024, a slight increase from $383 billion in FY2023, despite currency headwinds.
